### Metrics Introduction

**Influence/Contribution (OpenRank)**

The OpenRank metric, developed by X-lab Open Laboratory, is built upon the developer-project collaboration network and features multi-dimensional evaluation capabilities.

For **projects**, OpenRank focuses on **influence** to comprehensively assess their overall development status and community engagement；For **developers**, it emphasizes **contribution** as a key indicator, accurately reflecting their collaborative value and activity level within the open-source ecosystem. 

Additionally, OpenRank can aggregate evaluation targets at higher levels—such as **enterprises, organizations, and foundations**—revealing their strategic positioning and pivotal role in the open-source collaboration network.

Currently, OpenRank has gained broad recognition in both industry and academia, and has been incorporated into several authoritative standards and practices, including:
* The Open Source Governance Standards by the China National Institute of Standardization
* The Open Source Governance Whitepaper by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT)
* The Global Open Source Dashboard by the OpenAtom Foundation
* The Governance Toolkit for enterprise open-source offices

As a result, OpenRank has become an authoritative benchmark for measuring the health of the open-source ecosystem and its collaborative value.

## 1. Overall Macro Insights

### 1.1 Base Event
Basic events are the core data source of open source ecological analysis, referring to event log data generated by developer activity behavior on global open source collaboration platforms (such as GitHub, Gitee, etc.). Through statistical analysis of these events, we can have a macro-in-one insight into the development trend of the global open source ecosystem. This report covers data from two major platforms, GitHub and Gitee.

#### 1.1.1 GitHub Holistic Event Trends
In 2024, the total number of GitHub's global event logs reached **1.75 billion**, an increase of about **10%** on the same period last year. Although the growth rate slowed down from the high-speed growth period from 2018 to 2023, the 10% growth rate still indicates the key position of open source in global digital transformation. The main factors driving this growth include:
* **Popularity of AI tools such as GitHub Copilot**: Since the beginning of 2023, the widespread use of AI-assisted programming tools has attracted more developers, especially developers in the Southern Hemisphere.
* **Growth of developers**: The increase in the number of developers around the world directly drives the rise in event logs.
Figure 1.1 shows the growth trend of GitHub's annual event count, highlighting the continued activity of the open source ecosystem.
