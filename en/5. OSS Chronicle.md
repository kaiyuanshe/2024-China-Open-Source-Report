# Open Source Chronicle

## Preface

> Translator: Biaowei Zhuang, Reviewer: Ted Liu

In compiling this year’s Open Source Chronicle, we are profoundly reminded **that open source and AI, as dual engines of innovation in the digital era, are reshaping the global technological landscape at an unprecedented pace**. The 2024 Chronicle not only documents the rise of China’s open source influence but also highlights seismic shifts in the global open source ecosystem—where every breakthrough in technology, every paradigm shift in governance, and every geopolitical maneuver are inextricably linked to the future of open source communities worldwide. 

Due to the restructuring of chapters, our open-source chronicle for this year primarily focuses on significant events outside the development of artificial intelligence technology. Beyond AI, the open-source world in 2024 is equally fascinating, and we have summarized the following characteristics:

- **Open Source Technology Leaps Forward**
The proliferation of domestic programming languages, groundbreaking progress in homegrown AI and big data ecosystems, and the large-scale adoption of RISC-V chips underscore how open source continues to define the cutting edge of technology. 

- **Security Risks Reach Grave Proportions** 
The discovery of the XZ backdoor that lurked undetected for three years, coupled with state-sponsored supply chain attacks, has subjected open source defenses to their most severe test yet. 

- **Community Upheavals Intensify** 
Controversies such as the expulsion of Russian contributors from the Linux kernel project and the licensing shift of Redis that spurred the Valkey fork reveal deepening fractures in the collaborative foundations of open source. 

- **Geopolitical Tensions Escalate**
The U.S. tightened AI chip export controls, while the EU advanced open source compliance legislation, accelerating the global battle for technological sovereignty.

- **Governance Paradigms Evolve**
China’s Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling affirming the enforceability of GPL licenses, and the rise of Valkey as a Redis fork signaled a pivotal moment in redefining open source governance frameworks.

- **Education Initiatives Flourish**
Over 100 universities launched dedicated open source courses, and collaborative projects involving tens of millions of lines of code have catalyzed a new era of talent cultivation.

- **Policy Shifts Reshape the Landscape**
National and regional open source policies took effect across China, even as global compliance frameworks clashed, cementing open source as a strategic battleground in the digital economy.

This report transcends mere documentation; it seeks to illuminate critical trends. As AI begins authoring code, as geopolitical divides fracture technical ecosystems, and as legal precedents redefine open source boundaries, we stand at a historic inflection point. We hope this Chronicle — a tapestry of technological breakthroughs, security warnings, commercial experiments, and policy debates — will serve as a navigational beacon for China’s open source community through turbulent transformations. For the rules governing tomorrow’s open source world are being written today, by the hands of its practitioners.

## 4. Open Source Licensing and Compliance Governance

### 4.1 Case Ruling Highlights Elevated Status of Open Source License

> Translator: Jianfan (Sir) Wei, Reviewer: Jianfan (Sir) Wei

The health and stability of the open-source ecosystem rely heavily on the robust support of a legal framework. In 2024, a series of rulings related to open-source cases once again demonstrated the law's clear endorsement of open-source initiatives: open-source licenses hold legal standing, the use of open-source must comply with legal standards, and developers' rights are protected by law. These rulings will steer the development of open-source software toward a healthier, more orderly, and innovative direction.

- On February 18, 2024, the headline article in the *People's Court Daily*, titled "This Ruling Gives Software Developers Peace of Mind," sparked widespread discussion in the open-source community. The ruling, issued by the Supreme People's Court, is significant because it not only affirmed the legal validity of the GPLv2 license but also effectively protected the rights of software developers. The case involved Suzhou-based Network Technology Co., Ltd. (referred to as Suzhou Company), which claimed that its "OfficeTen" software had been misappropriated by Zhejiang-based Communication Technology Co., Ltd. (referred to as Zhejiang Company). Zhejiang Company argued that OfficeTen was subject to the GPLv2 license's "copyleft" provision and thus should be open-sourced, meaning their actions did not constitute infringement. Suzhou Company, however, contended that it had used technical means to ensure that the upper-layer functional software was "independent and separate," making it immune to the copyleft effect and thus eligible for copyright protection. On October 12, 2023, after reviewing the case, the Intellectual Property Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court ruled in favor of Suzhou Company, finding Zhejiang Company guilty of infringement. The court reasoned that "whether a software developer violates the GPLv2 license and whether they enjoy copyright protection are two relatively independent legal issues. These should not be conflated, as doing so could unreasonably deprive or restrict developers of the copyright they are legally entitled to based on their original contributions."

- Another interesting ruling came from the Intermediate People's Court of Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, in the "DedeCMS" case. Shanghai Zhuozhuo Network Technology Co., Ltd. sued a dental hospital for using its DedeCMS V5.7 - sp1 software without paying licensing fees. On February 19, 2024, the Wuxi court ruled against Zhuozhuo's primary claims. The court found that although this version of DedeCMS was commercial, it included open-source sphinxclient code protected under the GPLv2 license. As a result, DedeCMS was deemed to be subject to the GPL's copyleft provision. The court stated, "The software as a whole, due to its connection with the GPL-licensed library, should have been released under the GPL or a GPL-compatible license." The court further noted, "Zhuozhuo Company failed to comply with the GPL license terms when using others' code, which violates the principle of good faith and constitutes improper conduct."

  Consequently, the court ruled that the hospital's use of DedeCMS did not infringe on Zhuozhuo's reproduction rights. However, the hospital had failed to include attribution information on its website homepage as required by Zhuozhuo's licensing agreement, thereby infringing on Zhuozhuo's right of attribution. The final ruling required the hospital to compensate Zhuozhuo with 800 RMB and issue a public apology statement for 30 days.

  This case presents a subtle distinction from the earlier Supreme People's Court ruling on the OfficeTen case, primarily in two aspects: First, regarding whether the software was subject to the GPL's "copyleft" effect, the Supreme Court determined that OfficeTen was not affected by the GPL, whereas the Jiangsu Intermediate Court concluded that DedeCMS was indeed subject to it. Second, the manner in which the accused party obtained the source code differed. In the OfficeTen case, Suzhou Company had not publicly released the source code, and Zhejiang Company's acquisition of the code was deemed illegal. In contrast, in the DedeCMS case, the source code of the disputed version had been publicly released by Zhuozhuo Company.

  Additionally, the court made an important observation: "Zhuozhuo Company, relying on the disputed software as the basis for its claims, has initiated a large number of computer software copyright infringement cases in courts across the country, thereby reaping significant financial gains. This litigation model not only fails to effectively address the root causes of infringement but also consumes substantial public resources for dispute resolution. Such practices should not be encouraged or promoted."

- On February 14, 2024, the French Court of Appeal's ruling on the Lasso case once again unequivocally affirmed the robust standing of the GPLv2 license. French telecommunications company Orange had won a bid to develop a portal website for the French Electronic Communications Authority and, during the implementation, used the Lasso software library (released under GPLv2) published by Entr'ouvert. The court found that Orange had violated multiple provisions of the GPLv2, including failing to disclose the source code and engaging in unauthorized copying and distribution. Orange was ordered to pay 650,000 euros in damages. This ruling underscores the importance of corporate compliance with open-source licensing.

- After nearly two years, on July 5, 2024, three claims made by programmers alleging infringement by GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI were dismissed in court, leaving only two claims pending. The plaintiffs, five anonymous programmers, had filed a lawsuit in November 2022 against GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI, accusing their Copilot coding assistant of infringement. They argued that these companies used their code to train Copilot and provided it to other programmers without proper acknowledgment of their work or adherence to the original licensing terms. Judge Jon Tigar disagreed with this view, stating that the code suggested by Copilot was not sufficiently similar to the developers' copyrighted works. This lawsuit highlights the complex challenges of software copyright protection in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. While GitHub and others currently hold the upper hand, the ongoing controversy indicates a need for further refinement of laws to address the new challenges posed by AI.

- On November 22, 2024, Deno submitted a petition to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requesting the cancellation of Oracle's "JavaScript" trademark. Deno argued that "JavaScript" has become a generic term, that Oracle submitted deceptive evidence during the trademark renewal process, and that Oracle has not effectively used the trademark for many years. Over 14,000 developers supported this petition. Oracle has informed Deno that it will not voluntarily relinquish its rights to the "JavaScript" trademark. Deno will now begin gathering evidence to prove that "JavaScript" is widely recognized as a generic term. According to U.S. law, if a trademark is no longer in use with no intent to resume use, or if it has become a generic term, the trademark rights should be considered abandoned. If Deno's petition succeeds, it will remove barriers for the community to use the term "JavaScript," allowing its use in conference names, language specifications, and other contexts without legal threats. Deno is a JavaScript and TypeScript runtime environment based on the V8 engine, developed by Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node.js.

### 4.2 Controversial Incident Highlights the Difficulty of Reconciling the Interests of Multiple Stakeholders

> Translator: Jianfan (Sir) Wei, Reviewer: Jianfan (Sir) Wei

The series of open-source events in 2024 have shown us that an increasing number of people are developing a sense of open-source compliance. They recognize the importance of respecting the original authors' labor and ensuring their rightful interests. On the other hand, more and more people are realizing that the relationship between enterprises and the open-source community is becoming more complex, with intensifying conflicts of interest. Individual authors of open-source projects may face pressure from commercial companies, while open-source businesses may struggle against "free-riding" by cloud providers. Balancing personal interests, community interests, and commercial interests among open-source authors, open-source startups, and large corporations remains a challenging issue with no perfect solution. Breakthrough innovations in the management and development models of open-source projects are still needed.

- On October 23, 2024, the Linux kernel development community removed some maintainers with .ru-suffixed email addresses from the MAINTAINERS file. Many developers expressed confusion and sought explanations from the Linux community. Linus Torvalds personally responded, stating that the decision would not be reversed. Some netizens argued, "Linux is free software, and the freedom of free software should not be restricted by any factors, including nationality and political circumstances." However, the four freedoms defined by Richard Stallman, the father of free software, refer to the freedom to run, study, modify, and distribute the software, and do not include the freedom to contribute. Although this decision did not violate the spirit of the license, many intuitively felt that Linus was in the wrong, as his actions seemed to violate the Code of Conduct (CoC), which prohibits mockery, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.

- On March 20, 2024, the CEO of Redis announced that future versions of Redis would abandon the BSD license and adopt the RSALv2 and SSPLv1 dual licenses, neither of which meets the Open Source Initiative (OSI) definition of open source. The previously used BSD 3-Clause License was relatively permissive, while the new licenses impose restrictions, such as RSALv2 limiting commercial use and SSPLv1 requiring derivative works of the server to be open-sourced. Redis made this change to prevent cloud providers from freely using its source code for commercial gain. This move sparked significant controversy, as developers pointed out that Redis has many external contributors and that Redis the company did not initially participate in its development; it merely acquired the intellectual property and trademark rights from Redis' original creator, Antirez. Currently, Microsoft appears to have obtained a license from Redis to continue offering Redis products and services to its customers. Interestingly, just one day before Redis' announcement, Microsoft open-sourced the Garnet project under the MIT license, positioning it as a competitor to Redis. Many netizens commented, "Microsoft is trying to take away Redis' market share." This move by Redis also directly led to the creation of the Valkey project, which aims to replace Redis and continue its open-source development. Valkey was initially launched by Amazon, with engineers from Google and Oracle joining shortly after, and it became part of the Linux Foundation within a week.

- On November 15, 2024, a popular Bilibili UP主 (content creator) with over 12 million followers, known as "Teacher He," used the ASCII generator open-source project (licensed under MIT) developed by Viet Nguyen on GitHub in his video titled "I Made an Animation with 360,000 Lines of Notes..." but claimed, "We specifically wrote a software for this." This sparked widespread discussion. Viet Nguyen expressed dissatisfaction, accusing Teacher He of stealing his work. Netizens also criticized Teacher He for removing the original author's copyright notice in the code displayed in the video, violating the MIT license requirements. Faced with criticism, Teacher He admitted that the software was modified from the open-source program, stating, "As the project leader, I lacked professional sensitivity regarding technical matters. The project was not properly divided, and I failed to identify the issue during the process, leading to this mistake." Teacher He also contacted Viet Nguyen personally to apologize, and Viet Nguyen accepted the apology.

- Terraform, an infrastructure-as-code software developed by HashiCorp, was originally open-sourced under the MPL-2.0 license. In August 2023, HashiCorp changed its open-source license to the BSL. Subsequently, the Linux Foundation launched OpenTofu, an open-source fork of Terraform, which continued to use the MPL-2.0 license. In February 2024, an InfoWorld contributor pointed out that a feature in OpenTofu was similar to one in HashiCorp's new version of Terraform (a non-open-source version), and the code was also similar. Soon after, HashiCorp's legal team sent a notice to OpenTofu, accusing it of infringement. OpenTofu responded by stating that the claim was baseless, as both new features were based on modifications of the previous open-source version of the code, making similarities inevitable.

- In November 2024, Redis contacted Armin Ronacher, the maintainer of the Rust language's redis-rs client library, expressing a desire to take over the project. Redis claimed it wanted to create an officially supported Rust client with enterprise-level features while maintaining compatibility with the community version. However, Ronacher sensed from the conversation that Redis might believe the name "redis-rs" infringed on their trademark. Redis presented two options: either transfer ownership of the project to them or rename it. The technical community on HackerNews discussed this issue extensively, with developers expressing dissatisfaction with Redis' alleged misuse of trademark rights. Some developers suggested fully transitioning to Valkey, an open-source fork of Redis, while others pointed out that individual open-source maintainers could hardly afford the legal costs of confronting a commercial company.

- On August 6, 2024, ZLUDA was removed from GitHub. Initially, the ZLUDA project was an open-source initiative to provide CUDA support for Intel GPUs. Later, it received funding from AMD, and developer Andrzej Janik enabled it to run CUDA applications on AMD GPUs. According to the agreement between Andrzej Janik and AMD, after AMD ceased funding, Janik could open-source the relevant parts. However, six months after the open-source release, ZLUDA was taken down from GitHub at the request of AMD's legal department. Interestingly, this was not due to a legal challenge from NVIDIA but rather a shift in AMD's open-source strategy. Can open-sourced code be closed again? In this case, it happened. AMD's legal team argued that the initial email approval for releasing the code was not legally binding, meaning the open-source release was unauthorized from the start—a mistake! Developer Andrzej Janik stated that, given the circumstances, there was no other choice, but he remained undeterred. He planned to rebuild ZLUDA starting from the codebase prior to AMD's funding. In October 2024, ZLUDA returned to GitHub, open-sourced once again, and with support for AMD GPUs.

As the core component of SBOM, data formats determine the effectiveness of SBOM in delivering actionable information across the software supply chain. This standard addresses gaps in China’s SBOM data format standardization and resolves issues such as redundant fields in existing mainstream formats, ensuring interoperability and industrial resilience‌.

### 4.4 New Breakthroughs in Open Source Licensing in Emerging Fields, Models, Hardware Licenses Officially Released

> Translator: Yao (Leon) Liang, Reviewer: Yao (Leon) Liang

The development of emerging technologies has introduced new challenges in balancing intellectual property rights within legal frameworks, driving demand for innovative open-source licenses‌. While large-scale AI models are advancing rapidly worldwide, traditional open-source licenses—primarily designed for software source code—fail to adequately address rights allocation and governance for model components like parameters, weights, and datasets‌. Concurrently, open-source projects in hardware domains such as chips and robotics face compatibility issues due to fundamental differences between software and hardware IP rights systems, with no globally recognized mainstream hardware licenses currently available‌. To address these gaps, the OpenAtom Open Source Foundation has developed and released specialized open-source licenses tailored for AI models and hardware technologies‌.

- In September 2024, at the ‌OpenAtom Open Source Ecosystem Conference‌, the ‌OpenAtom Open Source Foundation‌ officially launched the ‌OpenAtom Model License, Version 1.0‌, a neutral and universally accessible open-source license designed to support the widespread adoption of large-scale AI models and drive the growth of open-source ecosystems in artificial intelligence‌. Developed through collaboration with institutions such as the ‌China Electronics Standardization Institute‌, ‌Huawei‌, ‌Ant Group‌, and ‌Grandall Law Firm (Nanjing)‌, the license provides a standardized framework for defining rights and governance of model components like parameters and datasets‌. Early adopters include technology leaders such as ‌CETC TaiJi‌ and ‌vivo‌, marking a milestone in aligning open-source licensing with emerging AI innovation needs‌.

- In December 2024, during the opening ceremony of the 2024 OpenAtom Developer Conference and the First Open Source Technology Academic Conference, the OpenAtom Open Source Foundation officially released Version 1.0 of the OpenAtom Open Hardware License. This license aims to provide a freely available open hardware license, maintained neutrally by the foundation, to support the prosperous development of the open hardware ecosystem.

### 7.2 International Policies

* **Related U.S. Policies**
    2024, the United States has taken a series of major initiatives in the field of artificial intelligence, reflecting the great importance and cautious attitude toward the development of AI technology. On the one hand, through legislative and judicial means, it has strengthened export control and security regulation of AI technology to guard against potential national security and social risks (some of the more radical policies are fortunately stillborn); on the other hand, it has actively promoted independent research and development of AI technology in an attempt to maintain a leading position in global competition. At the same time, the U.S. government's antitrust investigations and rulings on tech giants show the U.S. government's determination to maintain fair competition in the market. These measures will have a far-reaching impact on the global technology industry landscape, and deserve continued attention.
    * U.S. House of Representatives Passes National Framework for Strengthening Overseas Critical Export Restrictions Act (ENFORCE Act): On May 22, 2024, the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee overwhelmingly passed the bill, which seeks to tighten export controls on technologies such as AI models, particularly for countries such as China. 
    * California Governor Vetoes AI Safety Bill SB-1047: In September 2024, California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed SB-1047, a bill sponsored by Senator Scott Wiener. The bill aimed to set safety standards for large-scale AI models, but Newsom argued that it could place too heavy a burden on AI companies and undermine California's dominance in the field. 
    * U.S. court orders Google to overhaul its Android app business: In October 2024, U.S. Federal Judge James Donato ruled that Google may not restrict competition for the next three years by requiring it to open up its Android app store to allow users to download apps from other platforms and use other in-app payment methods. The move is aimed at breaking Google's monopoly in the Android app market.
    * U.S. Department of Justice Recommends Breaking Up Google's Chrome Business: In November 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice recommended that a federal court require Google to sell its Chrome browser and prohibit it from re-entering the browser market for five years. The move is aimed at preventing Google from using its browser dominance to consolidate its monopoly in the search engine market.
    * U.S. Launches AI “Manhattan Project”: In November 2024, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) under the U.S. Congress released its annual report, recommending that the U.S. government take reference from the Manhattan Project during World War II and launch a major special project on artificial intelligence, focusing on the nation's strengths and capabilities. The USCC recommended that the U.S. government launch a major program on artificial intelligence (AI) and focus the nation's efforts on accelerating the research and development of general-purpose AI (AGI) to cope with the increasing competition between the U.S. and China in science and technology.
* **Related European Policies**
    * Russian Government Considers Charging Local Businesses for Using Foreign Software: In May 2024, Russia's Minister of Digital Development, Maksut Shadayev, stated that the government is considering imposing a fee on domestic businesses that use foreign software in order to reduce dependence on foreign technology and promote the development of domestic technology. 
    * Germany's highest civil court rules invention by AI system DABUS patentable: In July 2024, Germany's Federal Court of Justice ruled that a lunchbox designed by the AI system DABUS can be patented, provided a human is listed as the inventor and the application clearly states that the product was conceived by an artificial intelligence. 
    * Germany's Federal Ministry of Justice Issues Draft Computer Criminal Code to Protect IT Security Researchers: 2024 In November, Germany's Federal Ministry of Justice issued a draft computer criminal code that aims to make clear that certain actions by IT security researchers will not be penalized by the computer criminal code, in order to encourage them to detect and remediate IT security vulnerabilities.
    * Switzerland Passes EMBAG Bill Requiring Public Agencies to Open Source Their Software: In July 2024, Switzerland passed the Federal Act on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Governmental Tasks (EMBAG), which requires all public agencies to disclose the source code of software developed by or for them, unless third-party rights or security concerns are involved.
    * Apache Software Foundation Expresses Concerns About Upcoming EU Software Regulations: Over the past two years, the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and other open source organizations have expressed concerns about the upcoming Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) in the European Union (EU), particularly with respect to software distributed and sold over the Web. Policymakers have introduced a new concept of “open source stewardship,” creating a new category of economic actor for the software industry. the CRA bill has been extended for one year, until full implementation begins in 2027. 
* **Related Policies in Asia**
    * In June 2024, the Japanese government proposed three major enhancement policies in the Comprehensive Innovation Strategy 2024, one of which is “Competitiveness Enhancement and Security-Peace of Mind Ensuring in the Field of AI”. The strategy aims to promote the development and application of AI technology through cooperation with a global perspective, while focusing on the safety and social acceptance of AI systems. On the other hand, Japan's copyright law allows the widespread use of copyrighted images and other materials for commercial purposes to train AI models without seeking permission. This has caused alarm and criticism from many creators.
    * In December 2024, Malaysia announced the establishment of the National Artificial Intelligence Office (NAIO), which aims to focus on policy development and regulatory issues in this way, and to promote AI leadership in Malaysia and beyond, thereby establishing Malaysia as a regional hub for AI.
