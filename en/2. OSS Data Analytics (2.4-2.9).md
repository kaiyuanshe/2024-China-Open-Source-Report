<center>Figure 7.1 2024 Global Developer Distribution Map</center>
<br>

Globally, developers are primarily concentrated in densely populated areas with well-developed internet infrastructure, such as:

* Coastal city clusters in China
* Tech hubs on the East and West coasts of the United * States
* Major economic centers in Europe
* High-tech industry clusters in India
* Metropolitan areas in southeastern Brazil

These regions boast a large pool of technical talent and a well-established tech industry ecosystem, providing strong support for open-source development activities. In contrast, in sparsely populated areas or regions with underdeveloped internet infrastructure—such as deserts, mountainous areas, and polar regions—developers are relatively scarce or even nonexistent. This pattern not only reflects the current global distribution of technological resources but also highlights the imbalance in digital economic development.

Notably, certain regions in emerging economies—such as parts of Southeast Asia and Africa—have seen a growing number of active developers in recent years. With the increasing global internet penetration and the expansion of technology education, open-source development activities are gradually extending beyond traditional tech hubs into emerging markets, injecting new vitality and diversity into the global open-source ecosystem.

### 7.2 Developer Work Time Analysis

This section analyzes the working hours of developers on GitHub and Gitee. The time in this section is based on UTC, which is 8 hours behind the UTC+8 time zone. The data is normalized to the [1-10] range using the min-max scaling method by default. In the time zone charts, the larger the dot area, the higher the value it represents.

#### 7.2.1 Holistic Developer Working Hours Distribution

**1 - GitHub Holistic Developer Working Hours Distribution**

<img width="1003" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a87be22b-c8f0-444b-ad13-1f92e20761e8" />
<center>Figure 7.5 GitHub Holistic Developer Working Hours Distribution</center>
<br>

By analyzing the distribution of working hours of holistic developers in GitHub, we can find that developers’ active hours are mainly concentrated between 6:00 and 21:00, and reach a significant peak at 12:00, which may be related to the triggering of scheduled tasks. In addition, the activity on Saturdays and Sundays is relatively low, indicating that developers’ working frequency on weekends has decreased.

**2 - Gitee Holistic Developer Working Hours Distribution**

<img width="1003" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bcd76ea-6205-4582-b54a-e76943080666" />
<center>Figure 7.6 Gitee Holistic Developer Working Hours Distribution</center>
<br>

The data clearly indicates that the active hours of developers on the Gitee platform align more closely with the daily routine of the UTC+8 time zone. This characteristic is closely related to the user demographic of Gitee as a domestic code hosting platform in China. Since the majority of Gitee's users are concentrated in China and East Asia, the distribution of developers' active hours reflects the typical work and lifestyle rhythms of this region.

Specifically, the peak working hours for developers generally occur between 9:00 AM and 8:00 PM, which largely coincides with the standard working hours in the UTC+8 time zone. Additionally, there is a slight dip in activity during lunch and dinner times, further indicating that developers' work habits are consistent with the daily routines in East Asia. Moreover, compared to global platforms like GitHub, the decline in developer activity on weekends is more pronounced on Gitee, which may reflect the cultural tendency of Chinese developers to rest or engage in non-work-related activities during weekends.

**3 - Holistic Developer Working Hours Distribution Excluding Bot Data**

<img width="1001" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e371f8d0-a841-46d6-84f0-9c11dfb4daaa" />
<center>Figure 7.7 Holistic Developer Working Hours Distribution Excluding Bot Data</center>
<br>

After filtering out bot data, the distribution of developers' working hours shows a more realistic and natural pattern. The data shows that developers are active mainly between 6pm and 21pm, a time zone where activity is significantly higher and more evenly distributed. This suggests that developers' work habits and actual activity trajectories are more clearly reflected after the interference of automated behaviours is excluded.

This distributional feature is highly consistent with the daily routine of human developers, which usually corresponds to the morning to evening work period. This pattern suggests that the vast majority of developers tend to code, collaborate, and contribute to open source projects during the main working hours of the day, while their activity decreases significantly during the late night and early morning hours. In addition, the even distribution of working hours may indicate that developers process tasks at a smoother pace, avoiding bursts of behaviour that are overly focused on particular points in time.

### 7.3 Developer Persona Analysis

This section categorizes GitHub users into four roles based on the events they trigger in open-source repositories: **Explorers**, **Participants**, **Contributors**, and **Committers**. The definitions of these roles are as follows:

**<center>Table 7.3 Four Developer Roles</center>**

| Role          | Definition                                                                 | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Explorer**  | Users who have starred a project.                                          | The user has some interest in the project.                    |
| **Participant** | Users who have created Issues or left Comments in a project.               | The user is actively engaging with the project.               |
| **Contributor** | Users who have submitted Pull Requests (PRs) in a project.                 | The user has contributed to the project's CodeBase.           |
| **Committer** | Users who have participated in PR reviews or merged PRs.                   | The user has made deep contributions to the project.          |


In general, these four roles form a progressive hierarchy, as illustrated in the diagram below. Based on this role framework, we quantify the top 10 projects by OpenRank across GitHub from three perspectives: role distribution, temporal changes, and developer role evolution, which corresponds to the ranking list in the second section.

<br>

![Developer Role Distribution](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry-mgdzakg.png)



<center>Figure 7.17 Developer Role Distribution</center>
<br>

The results show that:
- dio-lab-open-source: With the most contributors (21,276), this project is a tutorial course designed for contributing to GitHub projects, which explains the large number of contributors.

- microsoft/vscode has the largest number of explorers (14,701) and participants (12,522), but the number of contributors (579) and committers (388) is relatively small. This shows that the project has a very high level of attention and participation, but the core contributions are still completed by a smaller number of developers, indicating that its development threshold is high or the management is relatively centralized.

- home-assistant/core and godotengine/godot have a large number of explorers (10,596 and 15,208), and a certain scale of participants, but the ratio of contributors to committers is lower (1,300 and 1,072 contributors, 989 and 678 committers, respectively). This distribution suggests that they have some community involvement, but the actual development work is still undertaken by a small number of developers.

### 7.3.2 New Additions by Role in 2024

The new statistical criterion for roles is as follows: If a user was not in role X (e.g., contributor or submitter) before 2024 and became that role in 2024, they are counted as an effective addition to the X role.

For example, A submitted a PR to project B in 2021, but never participated in code review. In 2023, A reviewed a PR in project B, so A is called a new committer.

The detailed role additions are shown in the figure and table below.

| Repository                             |   New Explorer  |  New Participant |   New Contributor  |  New Committer  |

#### 7.3.3 Developer Evolution Perspective

The evolution process of developers is defined as: how many roles in an open source community transition to other roles. In this report, only developers transitioning from one role to a more advanced role were measured. For example, if a user was a participant before 2023 and submitted their first PR in 2023, they transitioned from a participant to a contributor.

| Repository                            |   Contributor -> Committer  | Participant -> Contributor | Explorer -> Participant |
|---------------------------------------|-------|------|-------|
| NixOS/nixpkgs                         |   287 |  188 |   204 |
| llvm/llvm-project                     |   134 |  289 |   185 |
| home-assistant/core                   |    66 |  103 |   155 |
| pytorch/pytorch                       |    82 |   78 |   168 |
| digitalinnovationone/dio-lab-open-source |     0 |   21 |     3 |
| odoo/odoo                             |    48 |   33 |    28 |
| microsoft/vscode                      |    23 |   50 |   272 |
| zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr             |    62 |   45 |    46 |
| godotengine/godot                     |    67 |  115 |   242 |
| elastic/kibana             |     12 |    26 |     3 |

<br>

- From the data in the tables and charts, we can observe the evolution trends of developer roles across communities in 2024. It continues to reflect a typical funnel model, where developers transition from explorers to participants, from participants to contributors, and eventually to core committers. This trend aligns with the natural progression of open-source community members from initial exploration to deep engagement.
- In various communities, we can still observe the typical funnel model, the evolution path from explorers to participants, and then to contributors and committers. Taking godotengine/godot as an example, in 2024, 242 explorers successfully transformed into participants, 115 participants transformed into contributors, and 67 contributors evolved into committers. This trend is also reflected in other communities, showing the natural development process of members from initial participation to deep contribution.
- In the NixOS/nixpkgs community, we observed a high number of conversions from contributors to committers, reaching 287, which further shows its openness to core contributions and high code review requirements, which helps to improve code quality and project stability.
- In addition, for projects like microsoft/vscode and godotengine/godot, the transformation from explorers to participants is quite significant, with 272 and 242 explorers completing the role transformation respectively. This shows that these communities are more attractive to new developers and provide a relatively low threshold for participation.
- In contrast, the role transformation of digitalinnovationone/dio-lab-open-source is still relatively small, especially the former has less evolution data, indicating that the community is still in the early stages of development. Similarly, elastic/kibana also has less evolution data, but this project is a mature project. It can be seen that when the project is developed and improved, its developers will also tend to be stable.

### 7.4 Bot Account Perspectives
Bot accounts are accounts that have been manually labeled and recognized for their contributions to the community. Currently, there are 1,410 bot accounts, with 181 additions compared to last year. Among these, 965 bot accounts were active in 2024, with **930 on the GitHub platform** and 35 on the Gitee platform. We analyzed all events in the repositories where these bots participated to study the changes in bot-related activities. By comparing the events generated by bot accounts with all events, we can assess the significance of bot accounts. Through comparative charts of different event types and their change rates, we can understand the reasons behind the changes in the number of bot-related events in 2024. Finally, by examining the 7x24-hour activity heatmap of bot accounts, we can gain insights into the working hours of these bots.

#### 7.4.1 Bot Account Event Changes
![Comparison statistics of annual bot events and overall events (2016-2024)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd667d20-ca92-4097-9b29-c4ebfe0bf579)
<center>Figure 7-8 Annual Comparison Chart of Events Generated by Bot Accounts vs. Total Events in Repositories</center>
<br> 

From Figure 7-8, it can be observed that the number of events generated by bot accounts has significantly increased over the past few years. Particularly, starting from 2020, the number of bot-related events has shown a rapid upward trend. In contrast, the number of events involving human developers, while also increasing, has grown at a relatively slower pace, with a more stable trend over time.

To elaborate further, between 2016 and 2024, the number of events generated by bot accounts grew from nearly zero to over 400 million, while the total number of events increased from approximately 100 million to over 700 million. The growth rate of bot-related events has significantly outpaced that of overall events, indicating that the role and influence of bot accounts in the community are continuously strengthening.

This growth is likely driven by the increasing adoption of bots in automating tasks, code reviews, continuous integration, and other areas, thereby reducing the workload on human developers and improving overall efficiency. Although the level of human developer participation has remained relatively stable, the rapid growth of bot accounts has compensated for this, ensuring a consistent rise in the total number of events.

In 2024, bot-related events accounted for 43% of all events, while events involving human developers made up 57%. This proportion further underscores the importance of bot accounts in the community. Not only has the number of bot-related events grown significantly, but their share of overall events has also increased, highlighting the increasingly critical role bots play in the community.

#### 7.4.2 Analysis of Bot Account Event Changes

![clipboard1](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkMDnSR8Jl.png)
<center>Figure 7-10: Annual Comparison of Event Types for Bot Accounts (2016-2024)</center>
<br> 

From Figure 7-10, we can observe the distribution of different event types across the years. Since bot accounts do not participate in MemberEvent, WatchEvent, ForkEvent, PublicEvent, or GollumEvent, these events have been excluded. Below are some key observations:

- PushEvent and PullRequestEvent are the most dominant event types, with their numbers far exceeding other event types.
- PushEvent reached a new peak in 2024, with the number of events approaching 300 million.
- The number of PullRequestCommentEvent has been steadily increasing.
- However, PullRequestEvent has been gradually decreasing.

The significant increase in the activity of bot accounts in code submission indicates that developers are increasingly relying on automated tools to submit code. At the same time, the number of PullRequestEvent is gradually decreasing, probably because the optimization of automated tools and processes has reduced the need for manual pull requests. The number of PullRequestCommentEvent and IssueCommentEvent continues to rise, indicating that robot accounts are more involved in code review and issue management. In addition, the number of other event types (such as CreateEvent, DeleteEvent, etc.) has also increased, reflecting the diverse activities of bot accounts in project management and maintenance.

![op and Bottom Growth Rates in GitHub Event Counts (2023 vs 2024)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae482c5b-7260-48d1-8ba0-9d0e5e2eebd2)
<center>Figure 7-11 Change Rate of Each Event in 2024 and 2023</center>
<br> 

Figure 7-11 shows the change rate of each event type between 2024 and 2023:

- IssuesEvent has the highest growth rate, reaching 783.5%, an increase of 19,333,491 times. This shows that the robot's activity in handling issues has increased significantly.
- PullRequestReviewCommentEvent and PushEvent have growth rates of 60.1% and 56.1%, respectively, with an increase of 1,786,717 times and 105,177,443 times.
- GollumEvent and DeleteEvent also show growth, 49.0% and 24.3%, respectively.
- CommitCommentEvent and ForkEvent show significant decreases, decreasing by 90.2% and 72.3%, respectively.

These change rates indicate that bot accounts have become more active in certain types of events, especially in handling issues (IssuesEvent) and code submissions (PushEvent). At the same time, the decrease in certain event types (such as CommitCommentEvent and ForkEvent) may indicate that these tasks are more manually handled by developers or that there is less demand for automation of these tasks.

#### 7.4.3 Bot Account 7x24 Hour Activity Heatmap

![clipboard9](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByGyf8RIyg.png)

From the 24-hour activity heatmap, we can observe distinct patterns in the distribution of bot account activities throughout the day. Below are some key observations:

- Peak Hours: Bot account activity reaches its peak at 12:00 PM (noon) each day. This suggests that most bot events are scheduled tasks, typically programmed to run at midday.
- All-Day Activity: Although noon is the peak activity period, bot accounts maintain a certain level of activity throughout the 24-hour cycle. This indicates that bots operate around the clock, handling various automated tasks.
- Weekdays vs. Weekends: The heatmap shows that activity levels are slightly higher on weekdays (Monday to Friday) compared to weekends (Saturday and Sunday). This is likely due to increased development activity on weekdays, triggering more bot events.

This activity pattern highlights the critical role bot accounts play in automating tasks, particularly in areas like scheduled tasks and continuous integration. By executing tasks at fixed times, bots effectively reduce the workload on developers and enhance overall productivity.

## 8. Commercial Open Source Insights

### 8.1 Definition of Commercial Open Source

Commercial open source refers to a model in which companies profit commercially by providing value-added services, technical support and customised solutions based on open source software. Commercial open source is about reducing software bugs and enriching software features through the participation of more people, while at the same time preventing a few people from leaving inappropriate backdoors in the software. Companies can directly gain economic benefits through the open source business model, and open source software will eventually feed back into the economy, allowing commercial companies to provide better products for users. The main difference between it and traditional open source is that traditional open source is primarily designed to promote the free use, modification and distribution of software, and tends to be community-driven to drive technological progress. But while commercial open source also follows the principles of open source, its main purpose is still to make a profit.

### 8.2 Analysis of Commercial Open Source Companies

![COSS Company - OpenRank Top 20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyL2lqGpkg.png)

<center>Figure 8-1 Commercial Open Source Companies - OpenRank Top 20 </center>
<br>

Grafana Labs, which has the Top 1 OpenRank thanks to the widespread adoption and community activity of its core product Grafana, closed a funding round in 2024 that valued the company at $6 billion. 

HashiCorp holds a significant position in the open-source domain, but its funding amount is relatively low at $349.2 million. This may be due to the fact that HashiCorp's business model and monetization approach differ from those of other companies. It primarily commercializes by offering enterprise-level support, services, and commercial editions of its open-source tools.

### 8.3 Analysis of Commercial Open Source Projects

![COSS Projects - OpenRank Top 20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkeGN2KM61g.png)

<center> Figure 8-2 Commercial Open Source Projects - OpenRank Top 20</center> <br>

Odoo, as the world's No. 1 free and open source PLM management system, has the highest OpenRank and a high funding amount, probably because Odoo has strong community support and activity, as well as a wide range of enterprise application modules, giving it a high degree of influence and market recognition among open source projects. 

Despite its technical recognition, oven-sh/bun's funding amount is relatively low, probably because the project is still at an early stage, the business model is not fully mature, or the market is still waiting to assess its business potential. As the project matures and market recognition increases, Oven's funding is expected to increase and its influence in the open source community is likely to continue to grow.

### 8.4 OpenRank Trends of Commercial Open Source Projects in the Last 5 Years

### 8.6 Case Studies

In this section，we take Hangzhou FIT2CLOUD Information Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as FIT2CLOUD) as an example to introduce an enterprise's open source commercialization practices. FIT2CLOUD's open source commercialization practice is to leverage open source to achieve efficient “**Product & Business**” co-innovation, make good software products and keep selling them. FIT2CLOUD's business model is a freemium model based on open source, and the establishment of this business model needs to solve two things at the same time: 1、Continuously expanding the number of free installations；2、Continuously improving the conversion rate of paid users. 

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyZXolv9yg.png)
<center>Figure 8-6: Open Source Freemium Model</center>
<br>

FIT2CLOUD's product philosophy is that "Good software is iterated." FIT2CLOUD leverages open source for efficient distribution, gets lots of feedback, and iteratively releases its products on a monthly basis. FIT2CLOUD's business philosophy is "Our products are bought, not sold." End-users are becoming key decision-makers in purchasing tool software products,and FIT2CLOUD enables online customer acquisition, sells standard products, and continues to increase cross-sell rates through a strong product portfolio. This cycle of "Open source attracts users - User feedback drives iteration - Iterated products attract more users - More users lead to more customers - More revenue leads to greater R&D investment" is  the key to the true flywheel effect of the FIT2CLOUD business model.

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryyynxwqkl.png)
 <center> Figure 8-7: FIT2CLOUD's Open Source Commercialization Practices</center>
<br>

FIT2CLOUD's milestones in open source commercialisation can be verified by four figures: 
1. **OpenRank Open Source Activity** ：FIT2CLOUD ranks 10th among Chinese enterprises and 47th globally in terms of OpenRank open source activity.
2. **OpenRank Open Source Influence**：FIT2CLOUD ranks 9th among Chinese enterprises and 42nd globally in terms of OpenRank open source influence. 
3. **Number of paying enterprises**: By the end of 2024, FIT2CLOUD has served more than 3,000 enterprise customers in various industries such as finance, manufacturing, energy, transport, medical care, communications, media, real estate, Internet, education, and so on. 
4. **Healthy Cash Flow** : In 2024, FIT2CLOUD recorded 2,511 cash transactions from open source commercialization products, with annual cumulative revenue exceeding CNY 100 million (≈$14.29 million USD).


## 9. Open Source Insights for Higher Education

The [Open Source Promotion Plan (OSPP) 2024](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/), as a significant platform for deep interaction between universities and open source communities, has achieved remarkable results this year, effectively promoting the development of open-source technologies and the cultivation of talent in higher education. Since the inaugural OSPP, the X-lab Open Laboratory has been deeply involved. This year, we conducted the following data analysis on the relevant data for OSPP 2024.

### 9.1 OSPP Macro Analysis

- **Overview of OSPP 2024**: This year's OSPP brought together **168 open-source communities** from various fields, including but not limited to operating systems, programming languages, artificial intelligence, and more. As shown in Figure 9.1, **2,537 students** from universities worldwide launched **561 open-source projects**, with **455 outstanding projects** completed.

![Overview of OSPP Event Participation](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B17Pu5f6kg.png)

<center>Figure 9.1 Overview of Event Participation</center>
<br>

- **Number of Communities**: Since the inaugural OSPP, the number of communities participating in the event has shown remarkable growth each year. By 2024, the number of communities surged to **168**, representing a significant increase compared to 2023. This growth trend can be attributed to several factors. On the one hand, more developers and project teams have recognized the powerful potential of open-source collaboration, attracting more communities to join the OSPP initiative. On the other hand, universities have increasingly emphasized the importance of open-source education, strengthening their collaboration with open-source communities to provide students with practical platforms.
- **Number of Students and Universities**: From 2020 to 2023, the number of student participants steadily increased, thanks to the gradual penetration of open-source culture in universities and the growing influence of the OSPP initiative. However, in 2024, the number of student participants slightly decreased to 2,537. This decline may be attributed to the moderate adjustments in project difficulty and requirements this year, as well as the diversion of some potential participants due to competition from other similar open-source events. As for the number of participating universities, since the launch of the event, its trend has largely mirrored that of student participation. That is, it steadily increased from 2020 to 2023 but saw a slight decline in 2024, for reasons similar to those affecting the number of student participants.
- **Number of Projects**: In the 2024 OSPP event, the total number of participants slightly decreased, but the number of projects still reached 561. In terms of project completion, 455 projects were successfully concluded, with the completion rate jumping from 70% last year to 81%. This outstanding completion rate can be attributed to several factors. First, the organizers optimized the project management process. At the initial stage of the projects, they provided students and mentors with more detailed and targeted guidance manuals and training courses, covering everything from project planning to overcoming technical challenges. Second, community mentors played a more active and critical role this year. They not only provided students with professional technical guidance but also shared valuable insights on time management, team collaboration, and more. Lastly, students have shown increasing dedication and commitment to open-source projects, enabling them to efficiently complete project development tasks. This has significantly contributed to the notable improvement in the project completion rate.

### 9.2 OSPP Annual Student-College-Related Distribution Analysis

- **Geographical Distribution of Universities**: The geographical distribution of participating universities in the Summer of Open Source 2024 is shown in Figure 9.2, while a comparison with the 2023 distribution is provided in Figure 9.1. In 2023, a total of 592 universities participated, including 489 domestic universities and 103 foreign universities, with foreign universities accounting for 17.4% of the total. By 2024, the total number of participating universities had decreased to 498, with domestic universities dropping to 399 and foreign universities slightly decreasing to 99. However, the proportion of foreign universities increased to 19.9%. This change indicates that while the overall scale of university participation has shrunk, the relative proportion of international collaboration has grown. As the international influence of OSPP continues to expand, it has attracted more attention from foreign universities. Despite fluctuations in absolute numbers, the rising proportion reflects a deepening trend in international cooperation. This shift is significant for fostering global open-source technology exchanges and promoting the international integration of talent cultivation. It also suggests that in OSPP’s future development, international collaboration will become a key growth driver and a distinctive highlight.

| 2023      | 592      | 489          | 103          | 17.4%        |
<center>Table 9.1 Changes in the Distribution of Domestic and Foreign Universities in OSPP from 2023 to 2024</center>
<br>

- **Educational Background Distribution of Students**: The educational background distribution of students participating in OSPP 2024 is shown in Figure 9.3, while a comparison with 2023 is provided in Table 9.2. It can be observed that, in addition to a large number of outstanding students from China, many students from various countries around the world also took part in the program. Among all participants, the majority were undergraduate and master's students, with a smaller proportion being doctoral students. Specifically, a comparison of the educational background distribution of OSPP students in 2023 and 2024 shows that the overall structure has remained relatively stable. The changes in distribution reflect that the dynamic development trend of the OSPP program among students of different academic levels remains steady, with its primary target audience still being undergraduate and master's students.

| 2023      | 3475     | 57%               | 41%          | 2%           |

<center>Table 9.2 Changes in the Educational Background Distribution of Students in OSPP from 2023 to 2024</center>

### 9.3 Contribution Analysis of OSPP by Year

Based on the above statistical data, a detailed analysis of the contribution levels of participating universities and students involved in various communities over the past two years of OSPP has been conducted. This analysis integrates the annual contribution data and the community OpenRank algorithm to provide deeper insights.

### 9.3.1 University Contribution 

The annual ranking of university contributions, calculated using the OpenRank algorithm, is shown in Figures 9.4 and 9.5. Figure 9.4 presents the top 20 universities with the most significant contributions in OSPP 2024, while Figure 9.5 displays the corresponding university rankings for OSPP 2023.

In the 2024 rankings, Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications topped the list with an OpenRank score of 85.13, involving 15 students, with an average OpenRank of 5.68 per student. Not only did its OpenRank score see a significant increase, but the number of participating students was also considerable, indicating a substantial overall contribution to OSPP. Longdong University ranked second with an OpenRank score of 61.37, but it had only one participating student, resulting in an exceptionally high per-student OpenRank of 61.37. This suggests that the student possessed unique technical expertise or innovation capabilities, allowing them to independently complete high-value project tasks. Similarly, Shanghai University secured third place with an OpenRank score of 42.21, with only two students participating in the program.

In the 2023 rankings, the top three universities were Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. It can be observed that these universities had relatively high overall contributions to OSPP. Among them, although Huazhong University of Science and Technology did not have the highest number of participating students, its outstanding per-student OpenRank performance allowed it to achieve the highest total OpenRank score. On the other hand, universities like Fudan University, Longdong University, Wuhan University, and Chengdu University of Information Technology may not have had the largest number of students, but the high contributions of individual students helped these universities secure higher final rankings.

<center>Figure 9.5 OSPP University Contribution Ranking 2023</center>
<br>

By comparing the university contribution rankings in 2023 and 2024, the changes in the rankings from multiple perspectives, such as ranking place and contribution, were also analyzed.

First, in terms of ranking changes, Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications and Longdong University have risen significantly. The former has risen from sixth place in 2023 to first place in 2024, making a huge leap. This ranking improvement reflects the school's rapid development and aggressiveness in open source project practice; while the latter has risen from twelfth place in 2023 to second place in 2024, and its ranking increase is also remarkable. Although only one student from the university participated in the project in 2024, the student made a very high contribution.

### 9.3.1 Student Contribution 

This section will provide a detailed analysis of the student contribution ranking data for OSPP 2023 and 2024, along with the changes observed. From the perspective of participating communities, the open-source communities students engaged in were highly diverse. These communities included a range of types, such as Apache Hadoop, MatrixOne, Spring Cloud Alibaba, and more. This reflects the broad technical scope of the OSPP project, offering students opportunities to engage in open-source practice across different areas. The specific rankings are shown in Figures 9.6 and 9.7.

- **OSPP Student Contribution Rankings 2024**:
    ![9-6 OSPP Student Contribution Rankings 2024](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk5V7SUaye.png)

<center>Figure 9.6 OSPP Student Contribution Rankings 2024</center>

- **OSPP Student Contribution Rankings 2023**:
    ![9-7 OSPP Student Contribution Rankings 2023](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJX3HSIp1x.png)

<center>Figure 9.7 OSPP Student Contribution Rankings 2023</center>
<br>

By comparing the student contribution rankings of 2024 and 2023, it can be observed that universities such as Longdong University, Shanghai University, and Xi'an University of Finance and Economics had students who ranked high in 2024. This indicates that in open-source projects, it is not only students from traditionally dominant universities who can achieve high contribution levels; students from relatively lesser-known universities, if they have sufficient skills and commitment, can also stand out in the rankings. 

Regarding the communities participated in, this year's OSPP situation is similar to 2023, with students still engaging in a diverse range of communities. However, in some specific communities, such as Spring Cloud Alibaba and MindSpore, there has been a significant increase in student contributions. This could be related to the project demands and development directions of these communities in 2024, as well as growing student interest in related technologies. On the other hand, the concentration of contributions in this year's OSPP has changed. While there are still some students with OpenRank scores far above the average, the overall gap has narrowed compared to 2023. This could be due to the promotion and development of the OSPP project, where more students have acquired effective methods for participating in open-source projects, thereby improving their contributions. As a result, competition among high-contribution students has become more intense.
