### 6.4 Evaluation Mechanisms for Open-Source Education

With the continuous maturation of China's open source ecosystem, the demand for open source talent will steadily grow. Therefore, accelerating the establishment of an industry-demand-oriented talent cultivation and evaluation system centered on capability and contribution holds significant strategic importance. Minister of Industry and Information Technology Jin Zhuanglong emphasizes: **"Optimizing the open source development environment** is critical. We must prioritize talent and international cooperation as core drivers of open source growth, cultivate fertile ground for development, and enhance the quality and efficiency of open source initiatives. To **foster a favorable development atmosphere**, stakeholders must collaboratively build an open source culture with Chinese characteristics, promote awareness through multi-dimensional outreach, amplify open source advocacy, and create a society that understands and actively engages with open source principles. To **cultivate high-caliber talent**, efforts should focus on establishing contribution-based evaluation systems that integrate open source achievements into career advancement metrics for employees and academic recognition for students. This ensures talent development progresses from academic institutions to community engagement and ultimately benefits society. Minister Jin highlights the need for leading enterprises and universities to pilot innovative evaluation frameworks, aligning with national strategies to reinforce the open source ecosystem."
