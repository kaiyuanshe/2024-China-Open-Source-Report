Introduction <a class="header-anchor" href="#metrics-introduction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Metrics Introduction&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Influence/Contribution (OpenRank)</strong></p><p>The <strong>OpenRank metric</strong>, developed by X-lab Open Laboratory, is built upon the developer-project collaboration network and features multi-dimensional evaluation capabilities. For <strong>projects</strong>, OpenRank focuses on <strong>influence</strong> to comprehensively assess their overall development status and community engagement；For <strong>developers</strong>, it emphasizes <strong>contribution</strong> as a key indicator, accurately reflecting their collaborative value and activity level within the open-source ecosystem. Additionally, OpenRank can aggregate evaluation targets at higher levels—such as <strong>enterprises, organizations, and foundations</strong>—revealing their strategic positioning and pivotal role in the open-source collaboration network. Currently, OpenRank has gained broad recognition in both industry and academia, and has been incorporated into several authoritative standards and practices, including: The Open Source Governance Standards by the China National Institute of Standardization, The Open Source Governance Whitepaper by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), The Global Open Source Dashboard by the OpenAtom Foundation, and The Governance Toolkit for enterprise open-source offices. As a result, OpenRank has become an authoritative benchmark for measuring the health of the open-source ecosystem and its collaborative value.</p><p>OpenRank References：</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376686121_OpenRank_Leaderboard_Motivating_Open_Source_Collaborations_Through_Social_Network_Evaluation_in_Alibaba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Shengyu Zhao et al: OpenRank Leaderboard: Motivating Open Source Collaborations Through Social Network Evaluation in Alibaba.

Through statistical analysis of these events, we can have a macro-in-one insight into the development trend of the global open source ecosystem. This report covers data from two major platforms, GitHub and Gitee.</p><h4 id="_1-1-1-github-holistic-event-trends" tabindex="-1">1.1.1 GitHub Holistic Event Trends <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-1-1-github-holistic-event-trends" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1.1.1 GitHub Holistic Event Trends&quot;">​</a></h4><p>In 2024, the total number of GitHub&#39;s global event logs reached <strong>1.75 billion</strong>, an increase of about <strong>10%</strong> on the same period last year. Although the growth rate slowed down from the high-speed growth period from 2018 to 2023, the 10% growth rate still indicates the key position of open source in global digital transformation. The main factors driving this growth include:</p><ul><li><strong>Popularity of AI tools such as GitHub Copilot</strong>: Since the beginning of 2023, the widespread use of AI-assisted programming tools has attracted more developers, especially developers in the Southern Hemisphere.</li><li><strong>Growth of developers</strong>: The increase in the number of developers around the world directly drives the rise in event logs.</li></ul><p>Figure 1.1 shows the growth trend of GitHub&#39;s annual event count, highlighting the continued activity of the open source ecosystem.</p><p><img src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_1/1-1.png" alt="1-1"></p><!----><br><h4 id="_1-1-2-trend-comparison-of-github-and-gitee-event-counts" tabindex="-1">1.1.2 Trend Comparison of GitHub and Gitee Event Counts <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-1-2-trend-comparison-of-github-and-gitee-event-counts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1.1.2 Trend Comparison of GitHub and Gitee Event Counts&quot;">​</a></h4><p>For comparison, we selected the <strong>top 30,000</strong> active repositories on each platform of GitHub and Gitee, and focused on eight types of events closely related to open source participation (such as CommitCommentEvent, PullRequestEvent, etc.). The analysis results show:</p><ul><li><strong>GitHub</strong>: The number of events continues to grow, but the volatility is large, reflecting the diversity and activity of its global platform.</li><li><strong>Gitee</strong>: The number of events has steadily increased, showing the steady development and standardization trend of domestic open source communities.</li></ul><p>Although the number of events on GitHub is still much higher than Gitee, Gitee&#39;s stable growth shows that domestic developers&#39; enthusiasm and contribution to open source are constantly increasing.

From 2021 to 2022, the growth rate gradually slowed down and entered a period of slowness. However, <strong>since 2023</strong>, the growth rate has rebounded. Although there has been a slight decline in 2024, the overall growth has remained stable, indicating the continued vitality and attractiveness of GitHub as the world&#39;s leading open source platform.</p><p><img src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_1/1-8.png" alt="1-8"></p><!----><br><h4 id="_1-2-2-gitee-active-repository-trends" tabindex="-1">1.2.2 Gitee Active Repository Trends <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-2-2-gitee-active-repository-trends" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1.2.2 Gitee Active Repository Trends&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Repository activity on Gitee grew rapidly from 2018 to 2020, reaching its peak in 2020, primarily benefiting from domestic open-source policy support and the establishment of the OpenAtom Open Source Foundation. After 2021, growth slowed down, but still reached a new peak in 2024 (Figure 1.9).</p><p><img src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_1/1-9.png" alt="1-9"></p><!----><br><p>On the Gitee platform, Review Comment events dominate absolutely, accounting for 75.6% of total active events, far higher than other event types (such as Open Issue, Issue Comment, Merged Pull, etc., which account for about 7%; Open Pull events account for only 5%). This distribution indicates that Gitee developers focus more on the code review stage, while being slightly less active in code submission and issue discussion compared to GitHub, reflecting the platform users&#39; high attention to code quality and the gradual maturation of standardized processes (Figure 1.10).</p><p><img src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_1/1-10.png" alt="1-10"></p><!----><br><p>Gitee&#39;s OpenRank value achieved significant growth from 2018 to 2024, especially with a substantial increase between 2019-2020, mainly benefiting from domestic open-source ecosystem policy support and developers&#39; active participation in the localized platform.

Analysis of Concentration Changes in Leading Projects in the Database Domain</strong></p><p>Over the past five years, the concentration of OpenRank and concentration of Activity for the Top 10 leading projects in the database domain have remained within the range of [29%, 35%]. However, in the most recent three years (2022-2024), there has been a decline of approximately 3 percentage points compared to 2020 and 2021, with a slight rebound observed in 2024. Specifically:</p><ul><li>The concentration of OpenRank reached its peak in 2021 at 33.9455%, and dropped to its lowest point in 2023 at 29.42372%.</li><li>The concentration of Activity peaked at 34.29604% in 2020 and fell to its lowest point of 29.96794% in 2022.</li></ul><p>This indicates that the concentration of top database projects shows a consistent change in both OpenRank and Activity metrics. Moreover, by comparing the peak and trough years and trends of the two metrics, it can be observed that <strong>OpenRank changes lag slightly behind Activity</strong>, with the time lag being roughly on a monthly to quarterly scale. This lag reflects the temporal logic between activity and influence in database top projects: changes in activity may occur earlier, while changes in influence gradually follow.</p><p><strong>2. The Recovery of Concentration in 2024 and Future Trend Predictions</strong></p><p>In 2024, all concentration metrics for leading projects showed an upward trend, and the month-on-month increase in Activity concentration was greater than that of OpenRank concentration. This phenomenon indicates that the resurgence in activity among top database projects will further drive the accumulation of influence. Based on past trends, it can be predicted that the OpenRank concentration in 2025 may accelerate its recovery, and the influence of leading projects over the entire domain will also significantly strengthen as a result.</p><p>As the influence of top projects increases, an important challenge they face is <strong>how to convert this influence into higher activity levels to further consolidate their position in the field</strong>. This dynamic relationship is particularly crucial for top projects to maintain an advantage in the increasingly competitive database sector.</p><p><strong>3. Intensified Industry Competition and Resource Allocation Challenges</strong></p><p>Looking at the OpenRank and Activity trends over the past five years, although the indicators for top projects have rebounded in 2024, overall growth has slowed. This suggests that <strong>competition for resources in the database sector is intensifying, and the pressure among leading projects is increasing</strong>. In this context, how to leverage existing advantages and maintain a leading position will be a critical issue for the future development of top projects.</p><p>Overall, the changes in concentration among leading projects in the database domain reveal the temporal relationship between activity and the dissemination of influence, while also reflecting the intensification of competition within the field. In the future, leading projects will need to place greater emphasis on resource integration and the conversion of influence to address domain competition and further solidify their central position in the database technology ecosystem.</p><h4 id="_6-3-2-growth-trends-in-various-subdomains-of-databases-over-the-past-five-years" tabindex="-1">6.3.2 Growth Trends in Various Subdomains of Databases Over the Past Five Years <a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-3-2-growth-trends-in-various-subdomains-of-databases-over-the-past-five-years" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;6.3.2 Growth Trends in Various Subdomains of Databases Over the Past Five Years&quot;">​</a></h4><p><img src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_6/6-10.png" alt="6-10"></p><!----><br><p><img src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_6/6-11.png" alt="6-11"></p><!----><br><ul><li>The development of database categoriess has remained relatively stable over the past five years, with relational databases dominating the field.

This pattern may be related to the fact that most database-related projects have corporate backing. Based on the active UTC time, the chart shows that the active time of the day begins at 2:00 UTC, reaching a peak time at 6:00 UTC and continuing until 10:00 UTC. At 11:00 UTC, activity significantly decreases, and by 18:00 UTC, the projects are no longer active. The two distinct peak time — 2:00 to 6:00 UTC and 6:00 to 10:00 UTC — correspond to the working hours in Asia and Europe, respectively (assuming a typical work start time of 9:00 local time, aligning with UTC+7 to UTC+3 and UTC+3 to UTC-1). As the overlap in working hours gradually decreases afterward, the work peak quickly diminishes. This analysis highlights the critical role of collaboration between Asia and Europe in the open-source database domain, underscoring the importance of their contributions to the field.</p><h3 id="_6-4-project-analysis-in-the-field-of-generative-ai" tabindex="-1">6.4 Project Analysis in the Field of Generative AI <a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-4-project-analysis-in-the-field-of-generative-ai" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;6.4 Project Analysis in the Field of Generative AI&quot;">​</a></h3><p>After another year of industry development, generative AI has demonstrated new patterns of growth.

In addition, the activity on Saturdays and Sundays is relatively low, indicating that developers’ working frequency on weekends has decreased.</p><p><strong>2 - Gitee Holistic Developer Working Hours Distribution</strong></p><img width="1003" alt="image" src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_7/7-6.png"><!----><br><p>The data clearly indicates that the active hours of developers on the Gitee platform align more closely with the daily routine of the UTC+8 time zone. This characteristic is closely related to the user demographic of Gitee as a domestic code hosting platform in China. Since the majority of Gitee&#39;s users are concentrated in China and East Asia, the distribution of developers&#39; active hours reflects the typical work and lifestyle rhythms of this region. Specifically, the peak working hours for developers generally occur between 9:00 AM and 8:00 PM, which largely coincides with the standard working hours in the UTC+8 time zone. Additionally, there is a slight dip in activity during lunch and dinner times, further indicating that developers&#39; work habits are consistent with the daily routines in East Asia. Moreover, compared to global platforms like GitHub, the decline in developer activity on weekends is more pronounced on Gitee, which may reflect the cultural tendency of Chinese developers to rest or engage in non-work-related activities during weekends.</p><p><strong>3 - Holistic Developer Working Hours Distribution Excluding Bot Data</strong></p><img width="1001" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e371f8d0-a841-46d6-84f0-9c11dfb4daaa"><!----><br><p>After filtering out bot data, the distribution of developers&#39; working hours shows a more realistic and natural pattern. The data shows that developers are active mainly between 6pm and 21pm, a time zone where activity is significantly higher and more evenly distributed. This suggests that developers&#39; work habits and actual activity trajectories are more clearly reflected after the interference of automated behaviours is excluded.</p><p>This distributional feature is highly consistent with the daily routine of human developers, which usually corresponds to the morning to evening work period. This pattern suggests that the vast majority of developers tend to code, collaborate, and contribute to open source projects during the main working hours of the day, while their activity decreases significantly during the late night and early morning hours. In addition, the even distribution of working hours may indicate that developers process tasks at a smoother pace, avoiding bursts of behaviour that are overly focused on particular points in time.</p><h4 id="_7-2-2-project-working-hours-distribution" tabindex="-1">7.2.2 Project Working Hours Distribution <a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-2-2-project-working-hours-distribution" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;7.2.2 Project Working Hours Distribution&quot;">​</a></h4><p><strong>1 - Working Hours Distribution for OpenRank Top 4 Global GitHub Repositories</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NixOS/nixpkgs</a></li></ul><img width="1004" alt="image" src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_7/7-8.png"><!----><br><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">llvm/llvm-project</a></li></ul><img width="1005" alt="image" src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_7/7-9.png"><!----><br><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">home-assistant/core</a></li></ul><img width="1003" alt="image" src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_7/7-10.png"><!----><br><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">pytorch/pytorch</a></li></ul><img width="1004" alt="image" src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_7/7-11.png"><!----><br><p><strong>2 - Working Hours Distribution for OpenRank Top 4 Chinese GitHub Repositories</strong></p><ul><li><strong>openharmony</strong></li></ul><img width="1003" alt="image" src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_7/7-12.png"><!----><br><ul><li><strong>DaoCloud</strong></li></ul><img width="1002" alt="image" src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_7/7-13.png"><!----><br><ul><li><strong>PaddlePaddle</strong></li></ul><img width="1004" alt="image" src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_7/7-14.png"><!----><br><ul><li><strong>Doris</strong></li></ul><img width="1004" alt="image" src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_7/7-15.png"><!----><br><h3 id="_7-3-developer-persona-analysis" tabindex="-1">7.3 Developer Persona Analysis <a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-3-developer-persona-analysis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;7.3 Developer Persona Analysis&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This section categorizes GitHub users into four roles based on the events they trigger in open-source repositories: <strong>Explorers</strong>, <strong>Participants</strong>, <strong>Contributors</strong>, and <strong>Committers</strong>.

Currently, there are 1,410 bot accounts, with 181 additions compared to last year. Among these, 965 bot accounts were active in 2024, with <strong>930 on the GitHub platform</strong> and 35 on the Gitee platform. We analyzed all events in the repositories where these bots participated to study the changes in bot-related activities. By comparing the events generated by bot accounts with all events, we can assess the significance of bot accounts. Through comparative charts of different event types and their change rates, we can understand the reasons behind the changes in the number of bot-related events in 2024. Finally, by examining the 7x24-hour activity heatmap of bot accounts, we can gain insights into the working hours of these bots.</p><h4 id="_7-4-1-bot-account-event-changes" tabindex="-1">7.4.1 Bot Account Event Changes <a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-4-1-bot-account-event-changes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;7.4.1 Bot Account Event Changes&quot;">​</a></h4><p><img src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_7/cd667d20-ca92-4097-9b29-c4ebfe0bf579.png" alt="Comparison statistics of annual bot events and overall events (2016-2024)"></p><!----><br><p>From Figure 7-8, it can be observed that the number of events generated by bot accounts has significantly increased over the past few years. Particularly, starting from 2020, the number of bot-related events has shown a rapid upward trend. In contrast, the number of events involving human developers, while also increasing, has grown at a relatively slower pace, with a more stable trend over time.</p><p>To elaborate further, between 2016 and 2024, the number of events generated by bot accounts grew from nearly zero to over 400 million, while the total number of events increased from approximately 100 million to over 700 million. The growth rate of bot-related events has significantly outpaced that of overall events, indicating that the role and influence of bot accounts in the community are continuously strengthening.</p><p>This growth is likely driven by the increasing adoption of bots in automating tasks, code reviews, continuous integration, and other areas, thereby reducing the workload on human developers and improving overall efficiency. Although the level of human developer participation has remained relatively stable, the rapid growth of bot accounts has compensated for this, ensuring a consistent rise in the total number of events.</p><p>In 2024, bot-related events accounted for 43% of all events, while events involving human developers made up 57%. This proportion further underscores the importance of bot accounts in the community.

Commercial open source is about reducing software bugs and enriching software features through the participation of more people, while at the same time preventing a few people from leaving inappropriate backdoors in the software. Companies can directly gain economic benefits through the open source business model, and open source software will eventually feed back into the economy, allowing commercial companies to provide better products for users. The main difference between it and traditional open source is that traditional open source is primarily designed to promote the free use, modification and distribution of software, and tends to be community-driven to drive technological progress.

Since the inaugural OSPP, the X-lab Open Laboratory has been deeply involved. This year, we conducted the following data analysis on the relevant data for OSPP 2024.</p><h3 id="_9-1-ospp-macro-analysis" tabindex="-1">9.1 OSPP Macro Analysis <a class="header-anchor" href="#_9-1-ospp-macro-analysis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;9.1 OSPP Macro Analysis&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Overview of OSPP 2024</strong>: This year&#39;s OSPP brought together <strong>168 open-source communities</strong> from various fields, including but not limited to operating systems, programming languages, artificial intelligence, and more. As shown in Figure 9.1, <strong>2,537 students</strong> from universities worldwide launched <strong>561 open-source projects</strong>, with <strong>455 outstanding projects</strong> completed.</li></ul><p><img src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_9/en/9-1.png" alt="Overview of OSPP Event Participation"></p><!----><ul><li><strong>Number of Communities</strong>: Since the inaugural OSPP, the number of communities participating in the event has shown remarkable growth each year. By 2024, the number of communities surged to <strong>168</strong>, representing a significant increase compared to 2023. This growth trend can be attributed to several factors. On the one hand, more developers and project teams have recognized the powerful potential of open-source collaboration, attracting more communities to join the OSPP initiative. On the other hand, universities have increasingly emphasized the importance of open-source education, strengthening their collaboration with open-source communities to provide students with practical platforms.</li><li><strong>Number of Students and Universities</strong>: From 2020 to 2023, the number of student participants steadily increased, thanks to the gradual penetration of open-source culture in universities and the growing influence of the OSPP initiative. However, in 2024, the number of student participants slightly decreased to 2,537. This decline may be attributed to the moderate adjustments in project difficulty and requirements this year, as well as the diversion of some potential participants due to competition from other similar open-source events. As for the number of participating universities, since the launch of the event, its trend has largely mirrored that of student participation. That is, it steadily increased from 2020 to 2023 but saw a slight decline in 2024, for reasons similar to those affecting the number of student participants.</li><li><strong>Number of Projects</strong>: In the 2024 OSPP event, the total number of participants slightly decreased, but the number of projects still reached 561. In terms of project completion, 455 projects were successfully concluded, with the completion rate jumping from 70% last year to 81%. This outstanding completion rate can be attributed to several factors. First, the organizers optimized the project management process. At the initial stage of the projects, they provided students and mentors with more detailed and targeted guidance manuals and training courses, covering everything from project planning to overcoming technical challenges. Second, community mentors played a more active and critical role this year. They not only provided students with professional technical guidance but also shared valuable insights on time management, team collaboration, and more. Lastly, students have shown increasing dedication and commitment to open-source projects, enabling them to efficiently complete project development tasks. This has significantly contributed to the notable improvement in the project completion rate.</li></ul><h3 id="_9-2-ospp-annual-student-college-related-distribution-analysis" tabindex="-1">9.2 OSPP Annual Student-College-Related Distribution Analysis <a class="header-anchor" href="#_9-2-ospp-annual-student-college-related-distribution-analysis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;9.2 OSPP Annual Student-College-Related Distribution Analysis&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Geographical Distribution of Universities</strong>: The geographical distribution of participating universities in the Summer of Open Source 2024 is shown in Figure 9.2, while a comparison with the 2023 distribution is provided in Figure 9.1. In 2023, a total of 592 universities participated, including 489 domestic universities and 103 foreign universities, with foreign universities accounting for 17.4% of the total. By 2024, the total number of participating universities had decreased to 498, with domestic universities dropping to 399 and foreign universities slightly decreasing to 99. However, the proportion of foreign universities increased to 19.9%. This change indicates that while the overall scale of university participation has shrunk, the relative proportion of international collaboration has grown. As the international influence of OSPP continues to expand, it has attracted more attention from foreign universities. Despite fluctuations in absolute numbers, the rising proportion reflects a deepening trend in international cooperation. This shift is significant for fostering global open-source technology exchanges and promoting the international integration of talent cultivation. It also suggests that in OSPP’s future development, international collaboration will become a key growth driver and a distinctive highlight.</li></ul><p><img src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_9/en/9-2.png" alt="Distribution of Participating Universities in OSPP 2024"></p><!----><!----><table><thead><tr><th>OSPP Year</th><th>Total Universities</th><th>Domestic Universities</th><th>Foreign Universities</th><th>Percentage of Foreign Universities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2024</td><td>498</td><td>399</td><td>99</td><td>19.9%</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>592</td><td>489</td><td>103</td><td>17.4%</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><strong>Educational Background Distribution of Students</strong>: The educational background distribution of students participating in OSPP 2024 is shown in Figure 9.3, while a comparison with 2023 is provided in Table 9.2. It can be observed that, in addition to a large number of outstanding students from China, many students from various countries around the world also took part in the program. Among all participants, the majority were undergraduate and master&#39;s students, with a smaller proportion being doctoral students. Specifically, a comparison of the educational background distribution of OSPP students in 2023 and 2024 shows that the overall structure has remained relatively stable. The changes in distribution reflect that the dynamic development trend of the OSPP program among students of different academic levels remains steady, with its primary target audience still being undergraduate and master&#39;s students.</li></ul><p><img src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_9/en/9-3.png" alt="Educational Background Distribution of Students Participating in OSPP 2024"></p><!----><!----><table><thead><tr><th>OSPP Year</th><th>Total Students</th><th>Undergraduate/Associate Percentage</th><th>Master Percentage</th><th>Doctor Percentage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2024</td><td>2537</td><td>56%</td><td>42%</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>3475</td><td>57%</td><td>41%</td><td>2%</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="_9-3-contribution-analysis-of-ospp-by-year" tabindex="-1">9.3 Contribution Analysis of OSPP by Year <a class="header-anchor" href="#_9-3-contribution-analysis-of-ospp-by-year" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;9.3 Contribution Analysis of OSPP by Year&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Based on the above statistical data, a detailed analysis of the contribution levels of participating universities and students involved in various communities over the past two years of OSPP has been conducted.

Figure 9.4 presents the top 20 universities with the most significant contributions in OSPP 2024, while Figure 9.5 displays the corresponding university rankings for OSPP 2023.</p><p>In the 2024 rankings, Xi&#39;an University of Posts and Telecommunications topped the list with an OpenRank score of 85.13, involving 15 students, with an average OpenRank of 5.68 per student. Not only did its OpenRank score see a significant increase, but the number of participating students was also considerable, indicating a substantial overall contribution to OSPP. Longdong University ranked second with an OpenRank score of 61.37, but it had only one participating student, resulting in an exceptionally high per-student OpenRank of 61.37. This suggests that the student possessed unique technical expertise or innovation capabilities, allowing them to independently complete high-value project tasks. Similarly, Shanghai University secured third place with an OpenRank score of 42.21, with only two students participating in the program.</p><p>In the 2023 rankings, the top three universities were Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. It can be observed that these universities had relatively high overall contributions to OSPP. Among them, although Huazhong University of Science and Technology did not have the highest number of participating students, its outstanding per-student OpenRank performance allowed it to achieve the highest total OpenRank score. On the other hand, universities like Fudan University, Longdong University, Wuhan University, and Chengdu University of Information Technology may not have had the largest number of students, but the high contributions of individual students helped these universities secure higher final rankings.</p><ul><li><strong>OSPP University Contribution Ranking 2024</strong>:</li></ul><p><img src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_9/en/9-4.png" alt="9-4 OSPP University Contribution Ranking 2024"></p><!----><ul><li><strong>OSPP University Contribution Ranking 2023</strong>:</li></ul><p><img src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_9/en/9-5.png" alt="9-5 OSPP University Contribution Ranking 2023"></p><!----><p>By comparing the university contribution rankings in 2023 and 2024, the changes in the rankings from multiple perspectives, such as ranking place and contribution, were also analyzed.</p><p>First, in terms of ranking changes, Xi&#39;an University of Posts and Telecommunications and Longdong University have risen significantly. The former has risen from sixth place in 2023 to first place in 2024, making a huge leap. This ranking improvement reflects the school&#39;s rapid development and aggressiveness in open source project practice; while the latter has risen from twelfth place in 2023 to second place in 2024, and its ranking increase is also remarkable. Although only one student from the university participated in the project in 2024, the student made a very high contribution.</p><h3 id="_9-3-1-student-contribution" tabindex="-1">9.3.1 Student Contribution <a class="header-anchor" href="#_9-3-1-student-contribution" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;9.3.1 Student Contribution&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This section will provide a detailed analysis of the student contribution ranking data for OSPP 2023 and 2024, along with the changes observed. From the perspective of participating communities, the open-source communities students engaged in were highly diverse. These communities included a range of types, such as Apache Hadoop, MatrixOne, Spring Cloud Alibaba, and more. This reflects the broad technical scope of the OSPP project, offering students opportunities to engage in open-source practice across different areas. The specific rankings are shown in Figures 9.6 and 9.7.</p><ul><li><strong>OSPP Student Contribution Rankings 2024</strong>:</li></ul><p><img src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_9/en/9-6.png" alt="9-6 OSPP Student Contribution Rankings 2024"></p><!----><ul><li><strong>OSPP Student Contribution Rankings 2023</strong>:</li></ul><p><img src="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/image/data/chapter_9/en/9-7.png" alt="9-7 OSPP Student Contribution Rankings 2023"></p><!----><p>By comparing the student contribution rankings of 2024 and 2023, it can be observed that universities such as Longdong University, Shanghai University, and Xi&#39;an University of Finance and Economics had students who ranked high in 2024. This indicates that in open-source projects, it is not only students from traditionally dominant universities who can achieve high contribution levels; students from relatively lesser-known universities, if they have sufficient skills and commitment, can also stand out in the rankings.</p><p>Regarding the communities participated in, this year&#39;s OSPP situation is similar to 2023, with students still engaging in a diverse range of communities. However, in some specific communities, such as Spring Cloud Alibaba and MindSpore, there has been a significant increase in student contributions. This could be related to the project demands and development directions of these communities in 2024, as well as growing student interest in related technologies. On the other hand, the concentration of contributions in this year&#39;s OSPP has changed. While there are still some students with OpenRank scores far above the average, the overall gap has narrowed compared to 2023. This could be due to the promotion and development of the OSPP project, where more students have acquired effective methods for participating in open-source projects, thereby improving their contributions. As a result, competition among high-contribution students has become more intense.</p></div></div></main><footer class="VPDocFooter" data-v-337c2e06 data-v-5f443411><!--[--><!--]--><div class="edit-info" data-v-5f443411><div class="edit-link" data-v-5f443411><a class="VPLink link vp-external-link-icon no-icon edit-link-button" href="https://github.com/kaiyuanshe/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/edit/main/en/data.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-v-5f443411><!--[--><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" class="edit-link-icon" aria-label="edit icon" data-v-5f443411><path d="M18,23H4c-1.7,0-3-1.3-3-3V6c0-1.7,1.3-3,3-3h7c0.6,0,1,0.4,1,1s-0.4,1-1,1H4C3.4,5,3,5.4,3,6v14c0,0.6,0.4,1,1,1h14c0.6,0,1-0.4,1-1v-7c0-0.6,0.4-1,1-1s1,0.4,1,1v7C21,21.7,19.7,23,18,23z"></path><path d="M8,17c-0.3,0-0.5-0.1-0.7-0.3C7,16.5,6.9,16.1,7,15.8l1-4c0-0.2,0.1-0.3,0.3-0.5l9.5-9.5c1.2-1.2,3.2-1.2,4.4,0c1.2,1.2,1.2,3.2,0,4.4l-9.5,9.5c-0.1,0.1-0.3,0.2-0.5,0.3l-4,1C8.2,17,8.1,17,8,17zM9.9,12.5l-0.5,2.1l2.1-0.5l9.3-9.3c0.4-0.4,0.4-1.1,0-1.6c-0.4-0.4-1.2-0.4-1.6,0l0,0L9.9,12.5z M18.5,2.5L18.5,2.5L18.5,2.5z"></path></svg> Edit this page on GitHub<!--]--></a></div><div class="last-updated" data-v-5f443411><p class="VPLastUpdated" data-v-5f443411 data-v-238f58e4>Last updated: <time datetime="2025-08-30T09:01:32.000Z" data-v-238f58e4></time></p></div></div><nav class="prev-next" data-v-5f443411><div class="pager" data-v-5f443411><a class="VPLink link pager-link prev" href="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/en/questionnaire.html" data-v-5f443411><!--[--><span class="desc" data-v-5f443411>Previous page</span><span class="title" data-v-5f443411>OSS Questionnaire</span><!--]--></a></div><div class="pager" data-v-5f443411><a class="VPLink link pager-link next" href="/2024-China-Open-Source-Report/en/commercialization.html" data-v-5f443411><!--[--><span class="desc" data-v-5f443411>Next page</span><span class="title" data-v-5f443411>OSS Commercialization</span><!--]--></a></div></nav></footer><!--[--><!--]--></div></div></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><footer class="VPFooter has-sidebar" data-v-4709876f data-v-027126fb><div class="container" data-v-027126fb><p class="message" data-v-027126fb>Released under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-027126fb>Copyright © 2014-present KAIYUANSHE</p></div></footer><!--[--><!--]--></div></div>
