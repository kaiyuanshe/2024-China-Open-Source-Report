# OSS Questionnaire

## 1. Background of the Report

Since the release of the "2015 China Open Source Community Participation Survey Report" at the beginning of 2016, kaiyuanshe has continuously published annual open source developer survey reports, aiming to present the current status and trends of China's open source development from multiple dimensions. In 2024, we continue this tradition, and with the help of data analysis methods and survey tools, further map out the landscape of China's open source world, assisting the open source community, developers, and industry professionals in understanding the changes in the domestic open source ecosystem.

This survey will continue to focus on the participation of various levels within the open source community, aiming to gain an in-depth understanding of the respondents' personal information, work status, participation in open source communities, and developers' technical backgrounds through multidimensional questions. The survey is designed with multiple role levels based on the depth of participation in the open source community, including users, participants, contributors, maintainers, and ecosystem operators, to comprehensively reflect the participation and influence of users at different levels within the open source community. The specific definitions are as follows:

- **User**: A user who has used one or more open source products.
- **Participant**: A user who interacts with the open source community (for example, engaging in communication with the open source community, participating in community-organized activities, etc.).
- **Contributor**: A user who has made substantial contributions to the open source community (including code and non-code contributions).
- **Maintainer**: A user mainly responsible for the daily operation of the open source community (including project maintainers, PMC members, etc.).

Additionally, ecosystem operators are users mainly responsible for the daily operation of the open source community, positioned above participants, and together with maintainers, are collectively referred to as operators.

Similar to previous years, this survey, in addition to collecting basic information, also includes targeted questions for different role groups to gain a deeper understanding of the participation motivations, contribution models, and influence of users at various levels.

**Basic Information** of this survey is as follows:

- **Target Audience**: Developers, community members, contributors, students, government and corporate managers

Survey data shows that respondents are mainly concentrated in the age group of 21-30, with respondents aged 21-25 accounting for the highest proportion, reaching 26.2%, followed by 26-30, accounting for 20.5%. This shows that the audience of the open source community is dominated by young people, especially adults in the early stages of their careers, who may be more interested in new technologies and open source projects and are more willing to participate and contribute. Overall, the distribution is similar to last year. 

In terms of gender distribution, male respondents accounted for the vast majority, reaching 71.0%, while female respondents accounted for 28.4%, and respondents from other genders accounted for only 0.6%. This data reflects that male participation is significantly higher than females in open source communities or related fields. But compared with last year's 25.83%, it has increased to a certain extent.

|                                Education Level Distribution                                |                                Regional Distribution                                |

|                                Industry Distribution                                |                               Occupation Distribution                               |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <img alt="12-Industry Distribution" src="/image/questionnaire/en/06_field_distribution.png" width="700"> | <img alt="13-Occupation Distribution" src="/image/questionnaire/en/07_work_status.png" width="700"> |

Respondents were mainly distributed in the Internet/IT/electronics/communications industry, accounting for 72.23%, indicating that the respondents mainly covered the field of technology.
In terms of professional identity, the most are in-school students, accounting for 36.3%, followed by back-end developers, academic researchers and open source/technical evangelist/DevRel. Overall, the survey subjects were mostly technical practitioners and students, and they covered multiple professional identities in the computer industry.

### 3.2 Open Source Participation Status
This section summarizes the frequency, motivation, form, and barriers to respondents’ participation in open source projects, revealing the activity and engagement of their interactions with the open source community and the factors that influence their participation.

#### 3.2.1 Level of Participation in Open Source Communities

|                                                               The role of the open source community participants                                                               |                                                                     The duration of exposure to open source                                                                     |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <img alt="19-open source community participant roles" src="/image/questionnaire/en/08_opensource_role.png" width="700"> | <img alt="20-Duration of exposure to open source" src="/image/questionnaire/en/09_experience.png" width="600">

The survey shows that the vast majority of members of the open source community are users (72.1%), while nearly half of the participants (55.1%) and a small number of contributors (29.5%). Compared with the 26.51% contributors last year, the proportion of those who made substantial contributions to the open source community has increased this year.

In terms of the duration of exposure to open source, 22.2% of respondents have less than 1 year of exposure to open source communities, and more than half of them have more than 3 years of experience.

We cross-analyze the respondents' role in the open source community to the question "How much do you think you are part of the open source community?"

|                        To what extent do you think you are part of the open source community                         |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <img alt="21-Sense of Belonging to the Community" src="/image/questionnaire/en/20_5_role_satisfaction.png" width="700"> |

It can be seen that in the open source community, maintainers, contributors, and ecological operations have a more sense of belonging than participants and users.

The next question is for respondents whose roles are "users" and above in the open source community.
#### 3.2.2 Use of Open Source Products

|                            Reasons for choosing an open source product                             |                             Factors that affect selection                              |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <img alt="27-Reasons for choosing an open source product" src="/image/questionnaire/en/10_opensource_usage.png" width="850"> | <img alt="28-Factors that affect selection" src="/image/questionnaire/en/12_project_selection.png" width="700"> |

The main reason why users choose to use open source software is that the product is free, accounting for 63.3%, which reflects the importance of cost-effectiveness in open source product selection. The factor "mainly secondary development" accounts for 56.5%. "Good community atmosphere" accounts for 51.7%, indicating that a positive, friendly community environment is crucial to attracting and retaining users.

When choosing an open source product, participants pay more attention to the degree of code specification and developer activity. This shows that users are not only concerned with the functionality and quality of open source products, but also the activity of the community and developers and the sustainability of the project.

|                           Problems encountered with open source products                            |                           Factors that drive open source contribution                            |

When searching open source products, "search through code hosting platform" is the most common way of discovery, accounting for as much as 64.6%. The second is "technical community, technical media recommendation", accounting for 56.0%. The proportion of "search through search engines" is 51.0%, while "technical communication and open source code" accounts for 41.1%.

The communication methods with the open source community are mainly domestic communication tools (such as DingTalk, WeChat, QQ, Feishu, etc.) and asynchronous communication tools (such as GitHub Issue, Discussion, Mail List, etc.), while international communication tools (such as Slack, Skype , Telegram, Lark, etc.) are also widely used. This shows that international open source communities mostly focus on asynchronous communication tools, which is significantly different from the domestic ones.

|                           Commonly used products / technology communities                           |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <img alt="35-Commonly used products or technology communities" src="/image/questionnaire/en/18_opensource_languages.png" width="700"> |

The vast majority of respondents mainly participate in the code hosting platform and open source community. In addition, nearly half of the respondents also participated in the open source community through domestic technology forums.

### 3.3 Open Source Contribution Status

The questions in this section are raised for respondents who have roles as "contributors" and above in the open source community. By analyzing the types and quality of respondents’ contributions to open source projects, we can evaluate their specific contributions to the community and identify potential ways to improve the efficiency and quality of contributions.

|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <img alt="36-Whether to participate in open source practice activities" src="/image/questionnaire/en/22_opensource_activities.png" width="750"> | <img alt="37-How long does it take to participate in open source every week" src="/image/questionnaire/en/24_weekly_hours.png" width="600"> |

Nearly one-third of student developers are actively involved in well-known open source projects such as Google Programming Summer (GSoC) and Open Source Summer (OSPP). Among them, GSoC attracted 7.4% of student developers, while OSPP attracted 28.7% of participants, and the two accounted for 36.1% of the total.

More than half of the contributors invest more than 5 hours a week on open source projects. More than 20% of contributors invest more than 10 hours a week in open source projects.


|                           Open source education and support in colleges and universities                          |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|

The respondents' contribution methods to open source projects are diverse, among which "code contribution" is the main contribution method, accounting for 30.5%. The second is "document-related contributions", accounting for 24.6%, which shows that the writing and maintenance of documents are also an indispensable part of open source projects. Next are "open source sermons" accounting for 13.8%, "open source community operation" accounting for 12.8%, "assisted community activities" accounting for 10.0%, and "open source-based commercialization projects" accounting for 8.3%.

At the same time, they participate in a variety of open source projects, but mainly based on technical foundations and infrastructure.

#### 3.3.4 Incentive Mechanism

|                               Incentive Methods                               |                             Source of Financial Returns                              |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <img alt="43-Incentive Methods" src="/image/questionnaire/en/29_incentive_types.png" width="700"> | <img alt="44-Source of Financial Returns" src="/image/questionnaire/en/30_financial_returns.png" width="400"> |

The incentive mechanism of open source communities is multi-dimensional, including not only financial returns, but also career development, community recognition and personal growth. All incentive methods have been positively evaluated, indicating that diversified incentive mechanisms have had a positive impact on developers' open source participation. At the same time, although the financial returns of open source projects are diverse, most developers value non-financial incentives more.

In terms of financial returns of open source projects, most developers participate in open source projects mainly for non-financial motivation, and nearly 40% of respondents did not receive direct financial returns from open source projects.

### 3.4 Community Operations Survey
The questions in this section are asked to respondents whose roles are "operators" in the open source community. This section will explore the respondents' views on open source community operations, including community management, event organization, communication mechanism, etc., to understand the effectiveness and improvement space of community operations, and provide a reference for improving community operations efficiency and member satisfaction.

#### 3.4.1 Overview of Open Source Communities

|                              Community User Count                              |                              Active Developers                               |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <img alt="45-Community User Count" src="/image/questionnaire/en/31_community_users.png" width="800"> | <img alt="46-Active Developers" src="/image/questionnaire/en/32_community_developers.png" width="700"> |

The open source community is primarily composed of small to medium-sized communities, with nearly 50% of operators' open source communities having fewer than 200 users. Among these, 21.8% of communities have fewer than 50 users, and 28.6% have 50-200 users. More than 30% of the communities have over 500 users.

#### 3.4.2 Open Source Community Management

|                                  Community Management Status                                   |                                 Community Support from Commercial Companies                                  |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <img alt="47-Community Management Status" src="/image/questionnaire/en/33_community_management.png" width="700"> | <img alt="48-Community Support from Commercial Companies" src="/image/questionnaire/en/34_company_support.png" width="700"> |

In terms of community management, about half of the communities have clear governance structures and dedicated personnel for daily operations, with these two factors accounting for 13.3% and 12.7%, respectively. At the same time, communities generally emphasize the development of rules and guidelines, as well as the continuous updating of documentation and resources to help new members integrate, with both factors having a proportion of 11.0%.

Regarding support from commercial companies, most open source communities receive active participation and support from commercial companies. Specifically, 10.2% of communities have commercial companies involved in co-development, 8.7% have received formal adoption by commercial companies, and 8.4% have received resources or financial sponsorship from commercial companies. However, 4.8% of communities report no support from commercial companies, and the "Other" category accounts for only 0.2%.

#### 3.4.3 Open Source Software Commercialization Survey

|                           Corporate Use of Open Source Software                           |                           Support for Commercializing Open Source Projects                           |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <img alt="49-Corporate Use of Open Source Software" src="/image/questionnaire/en/19_opensource_platforms.png" width="700"> | <img alt="50-Support for Commercializing Open Source Projects" src="/image/questionnaire/en/20_opensource_satisfaction.png" width="700"> |

The vast majority of enterprises tend to use open source software, with the highest proportion (43.3%) opting for the community edition. When it comes to the use of open source software, the ratio of enterprises with clear usage requirements and management regulations to those without such regulations is approximately 1:1.27.
