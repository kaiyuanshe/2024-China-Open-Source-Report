## OSS Commercialization

### Overview

### 1. Using open source as a tool, focusing on strengthening core capabilities to weather the winter together

Guest Speaker: Xu Zhixing (Guofang Innovation)

#### 1.1 Recently, the capital market's investment in open source has become more cautious. What are the contributing factors? Is the future outlook positive?

#### 1.2 How should enterprises and startup teams seek new sources of support and resources?

#### 1.3 Does that mean it's essential to formulate a commercialization plan as early as possible?

#### 1.4 In the past year, foundational AI models have attracted developers and customers through 'free' offerings and 'price wars.' Could this once again imply a culture of free usage, impacting the willingness to pay for software?

#### 1.5 Are there more opportunities in the AI field?

#### 1.6 In the middle layer of the AI field, there are many niche directions. How can companies and teams identify a long-term, sustainable direction rather than a short-term or transitional solution? Is there a possibility of future monopolization by major cloud providers?

#### 1.7 Are you optimistic about the overall entrepreneurial environment in the next phase? Which directions are more likely to experience rapid growth?

#### 1.8 What are the key observations regarding the most closely watched AI programming trends?

#### 1.9 Will open source continue to play a significant role in driving the software industry forward in the future?

#### 1.10 Open source is an investment for companies. For early-stage companies, how can they balance this investment?

### 2. When benchmarking against the U.S. loses its relevance, Chinese open source should find its own rhythm

Guest Speaker: Liu Jingyuan (Delian Capital)

#### 2.1 Recently, the capital market has become more subdued, and the enthusiasm for open-source software has also waned. How should we understand and assess this shift in market sentiment?

#### 2.2 Early-stage open-source companies invest more time and resources in refining their products. How do investment institutions view software companies with longer growth cycles? Do they prefer an earlier commercialization phase to validate the product?

#### 2.3 Would this impact investment institutions' willingness to invest in open-source projects or infrastructure software projects?

#### 2.4 In the current domestic business environment, open-source enterprises face many obstacles. What are the most critical challenges?

#### 2.5 What key aspects should be focused on in the commercialization process of open-source software?

#### 2.6 How should open-source enterprises evaluate whether to invest resources in international expansion?

#### 2.7 Is the outlook for open-source software startups and growth still optimistic in the near future?

#### 2.8 What can be learned from rapidly growing companies or projects?

#### 2.9 How can product design align with current real-world needs while avoiding becoming merely a transitional solution?

#### 2.10 What examples do you consider to be healthy open-source projects?

#### 2.11 What are the characteristics of projects that fall short of expectations?

#### 2.12 How can a project be assessed and evaluated? What are the key reference criteria?

### 3. Only when a single transaction reaches a million dollars can infrastructure enterprises dare to discuss the next steps

Guest Speaker: Ding Ning (INP)

#### 3.1 When will the next cycle be for open-source software to regain capital attention after the current downturn?

#### 3.2 During downturns, should companies still leverage open source for growth? (How to build confidence in open source and maintain continuous investment)

#### 3.3 How should companies balance their resource investment in open source at different stages?

#### 3.4 Some projects secure ample funding during periods of high capital interest but still struggle with stagnant growth. How can they break out of this predicament?

#### 3.5 How can an infrastructure software company determine whether its technology has the potential to continue evolving in its respective field?

#### 3.6 What is a reasonable timeframe for an infrastructure software project to achieve commercialization validation?

### 4. Through market cycles, infrastructure software remains the best investment target

Guest Speaker: Liu Chao ÔºàAtypical VenturesÔºâ

#### 4.1 2024 is yet another challenging year for open-source technology and infrastructure software. What difficulties will it face this year?

#### 4.2 Has the capital market adjusted its expectations for infrastructure software?

#### 4.3 How should infrastructure software companies decide whether to open source?

#### 4.4 How should companies determine which parts to open source, as well as the extent and method of open-sourcing?

#### 4.5 How can companies validate the impact of open-sourcing and make necessary adjustments?

#### 4.6 In the current macro environment, what promising aspects of infrastructure software are still worth investing in?
