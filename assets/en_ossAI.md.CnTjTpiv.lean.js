Overview <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-overview" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1. Overview&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Since the groundbreaking emergence of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, 2023 has been a pivotal year for the development of artificial intelligence. By 2024, the explosive growth of open-source AI has completely rewritten industry rules—shifting from technological monopolies to collective innovation, from lab-driven research to real-world industrial applications. An AI paradigm shift, led by open source, has officially arrived. As a result, the <strong>2024 China Open Source Annual Report</strong> has decided to dedicate a separate section, <strong>&#39;Open Source AI&#39;</strong>, to provide readers with a more comprehensive perspective on this transformative movement.</p><p>On July 27, 2024, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg published a groundbreaking article titled <strong>&quot;AI is approaching an open-source inflection point.&quot;</strong> He emphasized the profound impact of open-source AI on the entire industry, stating that as AI technology advances and community collaboration strengthens, open source will be the key driver of innovation and the widespread adoption of AI. The key points in his article provide a strong summary of the current state and development trends of open-source AI:</p><ul><li><strong>The Rise of Open-Source AI</strong> An increasing number of companies and research institutions are releasing open-source AI models and tools, a trend that is transforming the industry&#39;s competitive landscape. Open source is driving technological democratization, allowing more developers and enterprises to access and utilize cutting-edge AI technology.</li><li><strong>Balancing Business and Technology</strong> Enterprises leverage open-source AI to attract developer ecosystems while integrating proprietary and open-source technologies to build unique competitive advantages. This dual-track strategy allows companies to benefit from open source while maintaining the competitiveness of their core technologies.</li><li><strong>The Importance of Community and Collaboration</strong> The key to the success of open-source AI lies in an active developer community and a culture of collaboration. These communities provide strong support for model improvements, bug fixes, and new feature development, significantly accelerating the pace of AI innovation.</li><li><strong>Ethics and Transparency</strong> Open-source AI introduces new possibilities for transparency and accountability in AI technology. Open-source code makes the training and decision-making processes of models more transparent, helping to address bias and ethical concerns.</li><li><strong>Future Challenges</strong> Despite its vast potential, open-source AI faces several challenges, including copyright protection, data privacy, security vulnerabilities, and commercial sustainability. The industry must find solutions to these issues to fully unlock the potential of open-source AI.</li></ul><p>As Zuckerberg asserted, <strong>&quot;Open Source AI is the Path Forward.&quot;</strong> In 2024, open-source models like Llama and Mistral are rapidly approaching—and even surpassing—proprietary benchmarks. Chinese teams such as DeepSeek, Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen), and Zhipu are reshaping the global landscape with their <strong>&quot;radical openness&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;cost revolution.&quot;</strong> Platforms like Hugging Face and GitHub are bringing together hundreds of thousands of developers, making collaboration and knowledge-sharing the cornerstone of technological democratization. Open source is not just about making code accessible—it represents a <strong>redefinition of technological beliefs.</strong> It transforms innovation from being confined to research labs to reaching everyday life, shifting AI from corporate monopolies to a movement of collective creation.</p><p>However, the rapid surge in technology also brings <strong>unprecedented challenges.</strong> Behind the increasing convergence in performance lies the failure of benchmark testing and growing concerns over data contamination. The <strong>low cost and high availability</strong> of open-source models have triggered an intense global AI price war. NVIDIA’s <strong>chip dominance</strong> and the <strong>EU’s strict regulations</strong> reflect the complex entanglement between technology and power. Meanwhile, the <strong>misuse of synthetic data</strong> and the <strong>proliferation of deepfakes</strong> continuously raise alarms over ethics and security. This leads us to an inevitable question: <strong>As AI approaches human-level capabilities, are we truly prepared to coexist with it?</strong></p><p>To enhance the reader&#39;s experience, the editors of this chapter have opted <strong>not</strong> to use the traditional news listing format. Instead, they have synthesized insights from multiple domestic and international reports and in-depth analyses, blending <strong>a global perspective with local insights.</strong> This chapter systematically unpacks the contradictions and hopes of our era—<strong>from technological breakthroughs and commercial battles to policy struggles and ethical reflections.</strong> In the following sections, you will discover:</p><ul><li><strong>How Open Source is Breaking Technological Monopolies</strong> Bringing Llama 3 and GPT-4o into direct competition on performance rankings;</li><li><strong>Lightweight Models and Multimodality</strong> Why they have become the key to AI deployment and real-world applications;</li><li><strong>Embodied Intelligence and AI Agents</strong> – How they are redefining the boundaries of human-machine collaboration.</li><li><strong>The Power of Chinese Open-Source AI</strong> How it is leveraging price wars and full-scale open sourcing to break through the competition.</li></ul><p>As we stand at the doorstep of 2025, AI technology is reaching a critical open-source inflection point. The future industry leaders will be those who can strike the optimal balance between open source and commercialization. By embracing open source, AI has the potential to accelerate real-world applications while driving the entire industry toward a more open and inclusive future.Now, more than ever, we must remain clear-eyed: the vast horizon of open-source AI should not be a battleground for a few tech giants but a collective intelligence ecosystem built and shared by all.</p><p>May this report serve as a guiding light, illuminating both reason and warmth in the tide of technological progress.</p><h2 id="_2-2024-global-open-source-ai-current-status-and-development" tabindex="-1">2. 2024 Global Open Source AI: Current Status and Development <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2024-global-open-source-ai-current-status-and-development" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2. 2024 Global Open Source AI: Current Status and Development&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="_2-1-2024-open-source-ai-panorama" tabindex="-1">2.1 2024 Open-Source AI Panorama <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-1-2024-open-source-ai-panorama" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.1 2024 Open-Source AI Panorama&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There are different classifications for AI technology stacks and no industry standards, so this section uses some reported classifications for readers&#39; reference.</p><ul><li>Foundation Model</li><li>Model Deployment and Inference</li><li>Development Tools</li><li>Model Training and Fine-tuning</li><li>Monitoring and Observability</li></ul><p>The chart below takes only a selection of products globally as of the second quarter of 2024:</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="image"></p>',18)),e("blockquote",null,[o(i,null,{default:a(()=>[...t[0]||(t[0]=[n(" https://synaptic.com/resources/open-source-ai-2024 ",-1)])]),_:1})]),t[67]||(t[67]=e("h3",{id:"_2-2-2024-artificial-intelligence-timeline",tabindex:"-1"},[n("2.2 2024 Artificial Intelligence Timeline "),e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#_2-2-2024-artificial-intelligence-timeline","aria-label":'Permalink to "2.2 2024 Artificial Intelligence Timeline"'},"​")],-1)),e("ul",null,[t[3]||(t[3]=e("li",null,[e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"Open Source Models - 55"),e("img",{src:l,alt:"image"})])],-1)),e("li",null,[t[2]||(t[2]=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"API-Only Models - 63"),e("img",{src:"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ1Ed0ku1x.png",alt:"image"})],-1)),e("blockquote",null,[o(i,null,{default:a(()=>[...t[1]||(t[1]=[n(" https://huggingface.co/spaces/reach-vb/2024-ai-timeline ",-1)])]),_:1})])])]),t[68]||(t[68]=e("h2",{id:"_3-2024-artificial-intelligence-panorama-report",tabindex:"-1"},[n("3. 2024 Artificial Intelligence Panorama Report "),e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#_3-2024-artificial-intelligence-panorama-report","aria-label":'Permalink to "3. 2024 Artificial Intelligence Panorama Report"'},"​")],-1)),t[69]||(t[69]=e("h3",{id:"_3-1-research-technological-breakthroughs-and-capabilities-of-artificial-intelligence",tabindex:"-1"},[n("3.1 Research: Technological Breakthroughs and Capabilities of Artificial Intelligence "),e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#_3-1-research-technological-breakthroughs-and-capabilities-of-artificial-intelligence","aria-label":'Permalink to "3.1 Research: Technological Breakthroughs and Capabilities of Artificial Intelligence"'},"​")],-1)),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[t[5]||(t[5]=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"Performance Convergence"),n(" OpenAI's early lead is narrowing, with models like Claude (Anthropic's AI model) and Gemini (Google's AI model) catching up.

Early testing content was relatively simple, such as sentence completion tasks. However, as large models have evolved from &quot;text continuation players&quot; to &quot;programming experts&quot; and &quot;dialogue specialists,&quot; the testing content has become increasingly challenging.

Want an excellent coding assistant? Check how it performs on HumanEval. Need safety or factual accuracy? Check TruthfulQA or SafetyBench.</li><li><strong>Progress Tracking</strong>: Researchers use benchmarks to understand whether changes (such as fine-tuning or prompt updates) truly improve performance or just add hype.</li><li><strong>Standardization</strong>: With a fair competitive environment, anyone can verify the vendor&#39;s claims. If a new LLM claims to have world-class mathematical reasoning abilities, you can check whether it passed the GSM8K or MATH exams.</li></ul><p>Benchmarking is essentially a set of specially designed &quot;exam questions,&quot; which could be multiple-choice, programming problems, or conversational tasks. Each question has a clear correct answer or scoring standard. We &quot;bring the large model into the exam room&quot; and have it answer these questions. Then, we score it based on how many it answers correctly (or other performance metrics) and compare it with other models on the leaderboard. A high score represents the model&#39;s strengths, while a low score tells us which areas need improvement. It&#39;s like giving AI a comprehensive report card!</p><ul><li>Some benchmarks can become &quot;easier&quot; over time as models improve, thus losing their predictive value.</li><li>Benchmarks rarely simulate the chaotic conditions of the real world. For business use cases, custom tests are better than relying solely on public leaderboards.</li><li>Data leakage is a concern—if a model is trained on the test set, the results may be inflated. Dataset contamination and errors in benchmark testing are affecting progress evaluations and raising security concerns. &quot;Researchers are increasingly focusing on the issue of dataset contamination.&quot; &quot;Some of the most popular benchmarks have surprisingly high error rates, which could lead to underestimating the capabilities of certain models and pose security risks.&quot;</li></ul><p><strong>Evaluation Metrics</strong><img src="'+p+'" alt="image"></p>',6)),e("blockquote",null,[o(i,null,{default:a(()=>[...t[10]||(t[10]=[n(" https://x.com/i2ichardlin/status/1869125541212700797 ",-1)])]),_:1})])]),t[22]||(t[22]=s("<li><p><strong>Focus on Reasoning Computation</strong> OpenAI&#39;s o1 model demonstrates the potential of shifting computation to the inference layer to tackle complex problems, but it also comes with a significant increase in usage costs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multi-modal and New Architectures</strong> Multimodal models are gaining momentum, while researchers are exploring alternatives to Transformers (though Transformers remain the dominant approach) and hybrid architectures to enhance efficiency and address specific tasks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Synthetic Data</strong> The use of synthetic data is expanding, but concerns about model collapse raised by critics still persist.</p></li><li><p><strong>&quot;Lightweight&quot; Leads the New Trend in AI</strong> In recent years, as the scale of AI models has continued to expand, computing costs have also risen accordingly.

Specifically, it requires models trained with more than 1026 FLOPS of computing power to report to the federal government and submit security test results before going public. However, since this order is an executive order, it can be easily revoked by future administrations, so its long-term impact remains uncertain.</p><p>Meanwhile, individual states have started to introduce their own AI regulations, with California&#39;s SB 1047 bill being the most comprehensive but also the most controversial. However, due to strong opposition from many Silicon Valley leaders, the bill was ultimately vetoed by the Governor of California.</p></li><li><p><strong>EU AI Act Passed</strong> After long discussions and lobbying, the European Parliament finally passed the AI Act, becoming the first comprehensive AI regulatory framework in the world. The act will be implemented in phases and adopts a tiered management approach for foundational models.</p><p>However, major US tech companies have faced some challenges in adapting to these new regulations in the EU. For example, Anthropic&#39;s AI model, Claude, was not available to European users until May 2024, and Meta has temporarily withheld multimodal models from the European market. These examples highlight that multinational tech companies still need further adjustments and adaptations to comply with the EU&#39;s strict AI regulations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Collection Scrutiny</strong> As the demand for data grows among model developers, the policies surrounding the collection of user data have come under increasing scrutiny and attention. For example, Meta was required to offer EU users an option to &quot;opt out of global data participation,&quot; while X (formerly Twitter) has ceased using public posts from European users to train AI models. These changes reflect the growing emphasis on protecting user privacy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Global AI Competitive Landscape</strong> The Japanese government is actively supporting AI entrepreneurship and venture capital, hoping to inject new vitality into the economy through the AI boom. At the same time, as cutting-edge AI laboratories face increasing funding demands, some sovereign wealth funds are starting to play a more significant role in AI investments. This situation has also raised concerns about national security, as some of the funding may come from abroad, increasing the potential risks related to sensitive technologies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Public Computing Power Infrastructure</strong> The UK, US, and EU are all working to increase the supply of public computing resources, but compared to private companies, the resources available are still somewhat limited. Meanwhile, the Indian government has proposed an ambitious plan: they are willing to fund half of the costs to help build large-scale GPU clusters, with the condition that private companies cover the remaining expenses. This collaborative model opens up new possibilities for cooperation between the public and private sectors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Energy Consumption Issues</strong> With the rapid development of AI, large tech companies are struggling to meet the challenge of achieving &quot;net-zero emissions&quot; due to a significant increase in energy consumption. At the same time, the growth of AI has put a strain on existing energy infrastructure. Some countries have even started to restrict the construction of new data centers in order to control the rapid growth in energy demand.</p></li></ul><h3 id="_3-4-safety-identifying-and-mitigating-the-catastrophic-risks-of-future-high-capability-ai-systems" tabindex="-1">3.4 Safety: Identifying and Mitigating the Catastrophic Risks of Future High-Capability AI Systems <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-4-safety-identifying-and-mitigating-the-catastrophic-risks-of-future-high-capability-ai-systems" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.4 Safety: Identifying and Mitigating the Catastrophic Risks of Future High-Capability AI Systems&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Shift in AI Safety Attitudes</strong> In 2024, discussions surrounding AI safety saw an interesting shift. The concerns of &quot;AI is dangerous&quot; from 2023 evolved into a more positive attitude of &quot;come use my AI application&quot; in 2024. OpenAI&#39;s &quot;internal turmoil&quot; further signified the beginning of a backlash against the narrative of &quot;AI poses risks.&quot;</p><p>Despite the more optimistic atmosphere, governments around the world have not slowed down their efforts to govern AI safety. The UK was the first to establish the world’s first AI Security Institute (AISI, was AI Safety Institute), followed by the US, Japan, and Canada, all of whom are working to ensure that AI development is both efficient and safe.</p></li><li><p><strong>New Focus in AI Safety Research</strong> Researchers are increasingly focusing on &quot;jailbreaking&quot; attacks on AI systems. Although major labs have ramped up research into defending against these types of attacks, red team tests continue to successfully breach AI defenses.</p><p>What’s even more interesting is that research has revealed more subtle forms of attack, such as &quot;sneaky tampering&quot; with the preference data used to train AI models (RLHF, or reinforcement learning with human feedback), subtly manipulating the behavior of the model. These findings indicate that AI safety remains an ongoing cat-and-mouse game.</p></li><li><p><strong>Progress and Limitations of Alignment Techniques</strong> In the alignment techniques aimed at making AI more &quot;obedient,&quot; there have been several new attempts and challenges. For example, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained attention as an alternative to RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback), but research has found that it may encounter similar &quot;over-optimization&quot; issues.</p><p>At the same time, due to the advantage of supporting online learning, RLHF is still unlikely to be fully replaced in the short term. To better address these issues, researchers are trying to combine the strengths of both approaches. For example, they are exploring a new method called &quot;Direct Alignment Architecture Framework&quot; (DAAF), which aims to find more efficient and stable solutions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Breakthroughs in AI Explainability</strong> Anthropic recently successfully used Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) to analyze the internal activations of Claude 3 Sonnet, giving us a clearer understanding of how the model &quot;thinks.&quot; Following that, OpenAI improved SAE technology, making it applicable to larger-scale models.</p><p>These advancements make it possible to &quot;open the AI black box,&quot; helping to reveal the internal workings of the model. However, this technology also raises some concerns—if misused, it could lead to privacy or security risks, reminding us that while pursuing transparency, we must also exercise caution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Biological Risks</strong><br> Previous research by Anthropic raised concerns that large language models (LLMs) could accelerate the emergence of biological threats, but other labs have struggled to replicate this result. However, researchers also emphasize that, compared to LLMs, tools specifically designed for biological purposes (such as protein folding, design, and gene-editing tools) may pose more direct risks. Therefore, focusing on the safe use of these tools is becoming even more important.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Threat of AI Misuse</strong> Research from Google DeepMind points out that most instances of AI misuse are not due to complex hacking techniques, but rather because certain capabilities of generative AI are too easily accessible. For example, deepfake technology has been used for fraud, harassment, and even the creation of illegal pornography. These issues have become a growing area of concern.</p></li></ul><h3 id="_3-5-looking-forward" tabindex="-1">3.5 Looking Forward <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-5-looking-forward" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.5 Looking Forward&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Closing the Gap Between Open-Source and Closed-Source Models</strong> Mistral and Llama, among other open-source models, have firmly established themselves within the AI community.

As we approach the 2025 Year of the Snake Spring Festival, let us reflect together on the potential prosperity and challenges that AI may bring to human society in the future.</p><p>In his article, <strong>Dario</strong> explores the potential impact of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) on the <strong>21st century</strong>, asserting that AI is poised to achieve significant breakthroughs across multiple domains.</p><p><strong>Biology &amp; Medicine</strong>: Dario predicts that AI will accelerate advancements in biology and medicine, achieving in 5 to 10 years what would have originally taken 50 to 100 years. He refers to this phenomenon as the <strong>&quot;Compressed 21st Century&quot;</strong>, meaning that AI will enable humanity to accomplish a century’s worth of biomedical progress in a remarkably short period.</p><p><strong>Neuroscience &amp; Mental Health</strong>: Advances in AI are expected to significantly improve the treatment of most mental illnesses, potentially even curing them. Additionally, AI could expand human cognitive and emotional capacities, enhancing what Dario describes as &quot;cognitive and psychological freedom.&quot;</p><p><strong>Economic Development &amp; Poverty Alleviation</strong>: Dario believes that AI can bring positive impacts to developing countries in areas such as healthcare, economy, and governance. However, he emphasizes that global collaboration is essential to ensure that these nations are not left behind.</p><p><strong>Peace &amp; Governance</strong>: Dario points out that if AI development follows the right trajectory, it could ultimately steer humanity toward rule of law, democracy, and enlightenment values. While this outcome is not guaranteed, statistical trends suggest that AI will accelerate progress in these directions, making the path clearer and the goals more defined.</p><p><strong>Work &amp; Life Meaning</strong>: The development of AI may bring challenges such as inequality, economic growth concerns, and ethical dilemmas, including the right to opt out of AI-driven systems. Nevertheless, Dario believes that AI has the potential to safeguard freedom, individual rights, and legal equality, ultimately contributing to the creation of a better world.</p><p>Finally, Dario emphasizes that while AI presents many challenges and risks, we should strive for positive outcomes that benefit everyone. He calls for unity and collective effort to navigate the challenges of the future together.</p>',12))])}const ae=B(Y,[["render",X]]);export{oe as __pageData,ae as default};
