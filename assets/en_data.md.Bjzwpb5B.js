For <strong>projects</strong>, OpenRank focuses on <strong>influence</strong> to comprehensively assess their overall development status and community engagement；For <strong>developers</strong>, it emphasizes <strong>contribution</strong> as a key indicator, accurately reflecting their collaborative value and activity level within the open-source ecosystem. Additionally, OpenRank can aggregate evaluation targets at higher levels—such as <strong>enterprises, organizations, and foundations</strong>—revealing their strategic positioning and pivotal role in the open-source collaboration network. Currently, OpenRank has gained broad recognition in both industry and academia, and has been incorporated into several authoritative standards and practices, including: The Open Source Governance Standards by the China National Institute of Standardization, The Open Source Governance Whitepaper by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), The Global Open Source Dashboard by the OpenAtom Foundation, and The Governance Toolkit for enterprise open-source offices. As a result, OpenRank has become an authoritative benchmark for measuring the health of the open-source ecosystem and its collaborative value.</p><p>OpenRank References：</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376686121_OpenRank_Leaderboard_Motivating_Open_Source_Collaborations_Through_Social_Network_Evaluation_in_Alibaba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Shengyu Zhao et al: OpenRank Leaderboard: Motivating Open Source Collaborations Through Social Network Evaluation in Alibaba.

These data provide important basis for analyzing community dynamics and development.</p><p>In terms of activity trends, DaoCloud&#39;s performance is particularly outstanding. First, the number of Issues peaked in <strong>May 2024</strong> (exceeding 60,000), which might be closely related to new version releases or community discussions triggered by major events. Subsequently, the community&#39;s efficient response to issue closure and processing fully demonstrates its ability to quickly resolve problems. Additionally, the community&#39;s Commit activity has shown significant fluctuations historically, with two peaks occurring in <strong>2020</strong> and <strong>2023</strong> respectively, possibly related to important version releases or feature updates. The most recent peak appeared at the <strong>end of 2024</strong>, with a significant increase in Commit numbers, indicating the community&#39;s continued rise in activity. In terms of PR (Pull Request) performance, the number of opened, merged, and closed PRs in 2024 remained stable overall, reflecting efficient and orderly community development activities.</p><p>From an overall performance perspective, the DaoCloud community has demonstrated a healthy and continuously growing ecosystem. Its core projects <strong>public-image-mirror</strong> (public image service) and <strong>DaoCloud-docs</strong> (related documentation collaboration) have contributed major activity and influence in the community. Among them, public-image-mirror is dedicated to providing efficient and stable image support for developers, not only promoting the development of the DaoCloud community but also providing important support for domestic and international open-source users. As a documentation collaboration project, DaoCloud-docs significantly lowers the learning threshold for new developers by providing comprehensive technical documentation and development guides, and enhances user experience and technical dissemination capabilities through continuous optimization of document content.</p><p>In conclusion, the DaoCloud community has performed exceptionally well in multiple dimensions. The efficient handling of PRs and Issues highlights the close collaboration within the community, while the growth in the number of contributors, Commit activity, and PR activity indicates that the community is still developing rapidly and has the ability to attract more developers.

Analysis of Concentration Changes in Leading Projects in the Database Domain</strong></p><p>Over the past five years, the concentration of OpenRank and concentration of Activity for the Top 10 leading projects in the database domain have remained within the range of [29%, 35%]. However, in the most recent three years (2022-2024), there has been a decline of approximately 3 percentage points compared to 2020 and 2021, with a slight rebound observed in 2024. Specifically:</p><ul><li>The concentration of OpenRank reached its peak in 2021 at 33.9455%, and dropped to its lowest point in 2023 at 29.42372%.</li><li>The concentration of Activity peaked at 34.29604% in 2020 and fell to its lowest point of 29.96794% in 2022.</li></ul><p>This indicates that the concentration of top database projects shows a consistent change in both OpenRank and Activity metrics. Moreover, by comparing the peak and trough years and trends of the two metrics, it can be observed that <strong>OpenRank changes lag slightly behind Activity</strong>, with the time lag being roughly on a monthly to quarterly scale. This lag reflects the temporal logic between activity and influence in database top projects: changes in activity may occur earlier, while changes in influence gradually follow.</p><p><strong>2. The Recovery of Concentration in 2024 and Future Trend Predictions</strong></p><p>In 2024, all concentration metrics for leading projects showed an upward trend, and the month-on-month increase in Activity concentration was greater than that of OpenRank concentration. This phenomenon indicates that the resurgence in activity among top database projects will further drive the accumulation of influence. Based on past trends, it can be predicted that the OpenRank concentration in 2025 may accelerate its recovery, and the influence of leading projects over the entire domain will also significantly strengthen as a result.</p><p>As the influence of top projects increases, an important challenge they face is <strong>how to convert this influence into higher activity levels to further consolidate their position in the field</strong>. This dynamic relationship is particularly crucial for top projects to maintain an advantage in the increasingly competitive database sector.</p><p><strong>3. Intensified Industry Competition and Resource Allocation Challenges</strong></p><p>Looking at the OpenRank and Activity trends over the past five years, although the indicators for top projects have rebounded in 2024, overall growth has slowed. This suggests that <strong>competition for resources in the database sector is intensifying, and the pressure among leading projects is increasing</strong>. In this context, how to leverage existing advantages and maintain a leading position will be a critical issue for the future development of top projects.</p><p>Overall, the changes in concentration among leading projects in the database domain reveal the temporal relationship between activity and the dissemination of influence, while also reflecting the intensification of competition within the field. In the future, leading projects will need to place greater emphasis on resource integration and the conversion of influence to address domain competition and further solidify their central position in the database technology ecosystem.</p><h4 id="_6-3-2-growth-trends-in-various-subdomains-of-databases-over-the-past-five-years" tabindex="-1">6.3.2 Growth Trends in Various Subdomains of Databases Over the Past Five Years <a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-3-2-growth-trends-in-various-subdomains-of-databases-over-the-past-five-years" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;6.3.2 Growth Trends in Various Subdomains of Databases Over the Past Five Years&quot;">​</a></h4><p><img src="'+ft+'" alt="6-10"></p>',13)),o(i,null,{default:a(()=>[...t[66]||(t[66]=[n(" Figure 6.10 Trends in OpenRank Changes Across Various Database Subdomains from 2020 to 2024** ",-1)])]),_:1}),t[289]||(t[289]=e("br",null,null,-1)),t[290]||(t[290]=e("p",null,[e("img",{src:bt,alt:"6-11"})],-1)),o(i,null,{default:a(()=>[...t[67]||(t[67]=[n(" Figure 6.11 Trends in Activity Changes Across Various Database Subdomains from 2020 to 2024 ",-1)])]),_:1}),t[291]||(t[291]=e("br",null,null,-1)),t[292]||(t[292]=e("ul",null,[e("li",null,"The development of database categoriess has remained relatively stable over the past five years, with relational databases dominating the field.

Overall, the year 2024 has seen a slowdown in the development of the Generative AI (GenAI) field across the board. This is likely due to the fact that advancements in generative AI, particularly in the domain of large models, require massive investments in funding and computational resources. Following the incremental competition of 2022-2023, the AI industry in 2024 has shifted to competing in a saturated market. With the foundational frameworks of various AI products now largely complete, the focus of development has gradually transitioned from expansion to refining and evolving product forms.

Commercial open source is about reducing software bugs and enriching software features through the participation of more people, while at the same time preventing a few people from leaving inappropriate backdoors in the software. Companies can directly gain economic benefits through the open source business model, and open source software will eventually feed back into the economy, allowing commercial companies to provide better products for users. The main difference between it and traditional open source is that traditional open source is primarily designed to promote the free use, modification and distribution of software, and tends to be community-driven to drive technological progress. But while commercial open source also follows the principles of open source, its main purpose is still to make a profit.</p><h3 id="_8-2-analysis-of-commercial-open-source-companies" tabindex="-1">8.2 Analysis of Commercial Open Source Companies <a class="header-anchor" href="#_8-2-analysis-of-commercial-open-source-companies" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;8.2 Analysis of Commercial Open Source Companies&quot;">​</a></h3><img width="723" alt="COSS Company - OpenRank Top 20" src="'+_t+'">',14)),o(i,null,{default:a(()=>[...t[115]||(t[115]=[n("Figure 8-1 Commercial Open Source Companies - OpenRank Top 20 ",-1)])]),_:1}),t[407]||(t[407]=e("br",null,null,-1)),t[408]||(t[408]=e("p",null,"Grafana Labs, which has the Top 1 OpenRank thanks to the widespread adoption and community activity of its core product Grafana, closed a funding round in 2024 that valued the company at $6 billion.",-1)),t[409]||(t[409]=e("p",null,"HashiCorp holds a significant position in the open-source domain, but its funding amount is relatively low at $349.2 million.

By 2024, the number of communities surged to <strong>168</strong>, representing a significant increase compared to 2023. This growth trend can be attributed to several factors. On the one hand, more developers and project teams have recognized the powerful potential of open-source collaboration, attracting more communities to join the OSPP initiative. On the other hand, universities have increasingly emphasized the importance of open-source education, strengthening their collaboration with open-source communities to provide students with practical platforms.</li><li><strong>Number of Students and Universities</strong>: From 2020 to 2023, the number of student participants steadily increased, thanks to the gradual penetration of open-source culture in universities and the growing influence of the OSPP initiative. However, in 2024, the number of student participants slightly decreased to 2,537. This decline may be attributed to the moderate adjustments in project difficulty and requirements this year, as well as the diversion of some potential participants due to competition from other similar open-source events. As for the number of participating universities, since the launch of the event, its trend has largely mirrored that of student participation. That is, it steadily increased from 2020 to 2023 but saw a slight decline in 2024, for reasons similar to those affecting the number of student participants.</li><li><strong>Number of Projects</strong>: In the 2024 OSPP event, the total number of participants slightly decreased, but the number of projects still reached 561. In terms of project completion, 455 projects were successfully concluded, with the completion rate jumping from 70% last year to 81%. This outstanding completion rate can be attributed to several factors. First, the organizers optimized the project management process. At the initial stage of the projects, they provided students and mentors with more detailed and targeted guidance manuals and training courses, covering everything from project planning to overcoming technical challenges. Second, community mentors played a more active and critical role this year. They not only provided students with professional technical guidance but also shared valuable insights on time management, team collaboration, and more. Lastly, students have shown increasing dedication and commitment to open-source projects, enabling them to efficiently complete project development tasks. This has significantly contributed to the notable improvement in the project completion rate.</li></ul><h3 id="_9-2-ospp-annual-student-college-related-distribution-analysis" tabindex="-1">9.2 OSPP Annual Student-College-Related Distribution Analysis <a class="header-anchor" href="#_9-2-ospp-annual-student-college-related-distribution-analysis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;9.2 OSPP Annual Student-College-Related Distribution Analysis&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Geographical Distribution of Universities</strong>: The geographical distribution of participating universities in the Summer of Open Source 2024 is shown in Figure 9.2, while a comparison with the 2023 distribution is provided in Figure 9.1.

By 2024, the total number of participating universities had decreased to 498, with domestic universities dropping to 399 and foreign universities slightly decreasing to 99. However, the proportion of foreign universities increased to 19.9%. This change indicates that while the overall scale of university participation has shrunk, the relative proportion of international collaboration has grown. As the international influence of OSPP continues to expand, it has attracted more attention from foreign universities. Despite fluctuations in absolute numbers, the rising proportion reflects a deepening trend in international cooperation. This shift is significant for fostering global open-source technology exchanges and promoting the international integration of talent cultivation. It also suggests that in OSPP’s future development, international collaboration will become a key growth driver and a distinctive highlight.</li></ul><p><img src="'+ie+'" alt="Distribution of Participating Universities in OSPP 2024"></p>',4)),o(i,null,{default:a(()=>[...t[123]||(t[123]=[n("Figure 9.2 Distribution of Participating Universities in OSPP 2024",-1)])]),_:1}),o(i,null,{default:a(()=>[...t[124]||(t[124]=[n("Table 9.1 Changes in the Distribution of Domestic and Foreign Universities in OSPP from 2023 to 2024",-1)])]),_:1}),t[434]||(t[434]=r('<table><thead><tr><th>OSPP Year</th><th>Total Universities</th><th>Domestic Universities</th><th>Foreign Universities</th><th>Percentage of Foreign Universities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2024</td><td>498</td><td>399</td><td>99</td><td>19.9%</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>592</td><td>489</td><td>103</td><td>17.4%</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><strong>Educational Background Distribution of Students</strong>: The educational background distribution of students participating in OSPP 2024 is shown in Figure 9.3, while a comparison with 2023 is provided in Table 9.2.
