In 2024, we continue this tradition, and with the help of data analysis methods and survey tools, further map out the landscape of China&#39;s open source world, assisting the open source community, developers, and industry professionals in understanding the changes in the domestic open source ecosystem.</p><p>This survey will continue to focus on the participation of various levels within the open source community, aiming to gain an in-depth understanding of the respondents&#39; personal information, work status, participation in open source communities, and developers&#39; technical backgrounds through multidimensional questions. The survey is designed with multiple role levels based on the depth of participation in the open source community, including users, participants, contributors, maintainers, and ecosystem operators, to comprehensively reflect the participation and influence of users at different levels within the open source community. The specific definitions are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>User</strong>: A user who has used one or more open source products.</li><li><strong>Participant</strong>: A user who interacts with the open source community (for example, engaging in communication with the open source community, participating in community-organized activities, etc.).</li><li><strong>Contributor</strong>: A user who has made substantial contributions to the open source community (including code and non-code contributions).</li><li><strong>Maintainer</strong>: A user mainly responsible for the daily operation of the open source community (including project maintainers, PMC members, etc.).</li></ul><p>Additionally, ecosystem operators are users mainly responsible for the daily operation of the open source community, positioned above participants, and together with maintainers, are collectively referred to as operators.</p><p>Similar to previous years, this survey, in addition to collecting basic information, also includes targeted questions for different role groups to gain a deeper understanding of the participation motivations, contribution models, and influence of users at various levels.</p><p><strong>Basic Information</strong> of this survey is as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Target Audience</strong>: Developers, community members, contributors, students, government and corporate managers</li><li><strong>Survey Content</strong>: Mainly covers personal information, work status, open source community participation, and developers&#39; technical background</li><li><strong>Survey Method</strong>: Sample and data collection via online questionnaire, data analyzed using cross-comparison</li><li><strong>Distribution Channels</strong>: Online promotion via official accounts, and offline distribution through Open Source Society, OSCAR China Industry Conference, PyCon, 2024 9th China Open Source Annual Conference, and other multi-channel platforms.</li><li><strong>Question Types</strong>: Single choice, multiple choice, open-ended</li><li><strong>Number of Questions</strong>: 41</li><li><strong>Sample Size</strong>: 631</li></ul><h2 id="_2-preview-of-questionnaire-results" tabindex="-1">2.
